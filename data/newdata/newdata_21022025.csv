After almost three years out of competition, Independent Neutral Athlete Daria Rogozina claimed the world title. The men’s win went to Norwegian athlete The post Jorgen Baklid and Daria Rogozina win World Championship Winter Duathlon appeared first on Triathlon Today .",https://tri-today.com/rss,"<p>The 2025 Winter Duathlon World Championships showcased some of the world&#8217;s elite athletes, competing for the prestigious title in the breathtaking landscape of Cogne, Italy, on the heart of the Aosta Valley. After almost three years out of competition, Independent Neutral Athlete Daria Rogozina claimed the world title. The men&#8217;s win went to Norwegian athlete Jorgen Baklid</p>



<p>The Winter Duathlon World Championships kicked off three days of competition on the snow in Cogne, a picturesque winter resort that followed in the footsteps of Pragelato, which hosted last year&#8217;s Winter Triathlon World Championships.</p>



<p>The Elite, U23 and Junior athletes faced a race format consisted of two laps of 1 km each running, followed by two laps of 2 km each on skis, and then a repeat of each segment for a a total distance of 4 km running and 8 km skiing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neutral Athlete Daria Rogozina clinched the Winter Duathlon world title in Cogne, reinforcing her status as a formidable competitor. A three-time winter triathlon world champion (2018, 2019, 2022) and a bronze medalist in 2021, Rogozina proved her mettle. Born in 1996, she showcased her skiing prowess, claiming victory in her return to competition after being declared a Neutral Athlete just days before the race. Her last event was in 2022.</p>



<p>Norway’s Ine Skjellum, the silver medalist and last year&#8217;s Duathlon World Champion, delivered a remarkable performance, particularly in the running segments. However, she was unable to keep pace with Rogozina during the ski sections. The bronze medal went to Helena Karásková from the Czech Republic, who is a consistent presence in cross triathlon and cross duathlon events.</p>



<p>In the opening leg, a group of 17 women entered transition together, showcasing their speed and skill. Unfortunately, Skjellum lost valuable seconds when she mistakenly went to transition instead of turing for the second loop, having to go back and play cat and mouse with the other leaders for a bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogozina quickly established her dominance in the skiing segment, clocking the fastest split by nearly 20 seconds, asserting a gap that proved insurmountable. On the second running leg, Skjellum and her teammate Kristin Waaktaar Opland took charge of the chase group alongside Karásková. However, Karásková&#8217;s exceptional skiing ability allowed her to leapfrog into a strong bronze position.</p>



<p>As the competitors approached the finish line, Rogozina celebrated her victory with a lead of over 40 seconds ahead of Skjellum, who joyfully crossed the line in second place. Karásková secured the bronze, while Natalie Brlicova (CZE) finished fourth and Carina Wasle from Austria rounded out the top five.</p>



<p><strong>Men&#8217;s event</strong></p>



<p>It was a fantastic day for Norway at the Men’s Winter Duathlon World Championships held in Cogne, Italy, as Jorgen Baklid delivered a masterclass on the snow, excelling in both running and skiing to claim the world title for the first time in his young career. His teammate Hans Christian Tungesvik crossed the finish line in third place, with another Norwegian rounding out the top 5 and three more finishing in the top 15. Only Oleg Chestikov (AIN) managed to cross the finish line between the Norwegians, claiming the silver medal.</p>



<p>The picturesque town of Cogne, located in the Aosta Valley, hosted the first day of competition for the World Triathlon Winter Championships, where Junior, U23, and Elite athletes vied for the Winter Duathlon world titles under perfect conditions at the cross-country ski resort</p>



<p>Local hero and last year’s World Champion, Franco Pesavento, pushed the race hard from the very beginning, achieving the fastest run split of the day with a time of 7:02 for a challenging 2 km run in slippery snow. However, it was not enough to keep some of the top skiers at bay.</p>



<p>During the first leg on skis, Viorel Palici from Romania moved into first place, followed by a strong group of Norwegians, all of whom have impressive backgrounds as cross-country ski athletes. However, it was the second transition where significant differences began to emerge. Chestikov and Ivan Zalavtsev (AIN) opted to leave their boots on their skis, allowing them to complete the third transition almost 15 seconds faster than the Norwegian and Italian athletes.</p>



<p>By the time they all reached the final run segment, Baklid had a small 10-second lead that proved sufficient to maintain his position, ultimately crossing the finish line first. Chestikov held onto second place, while Hans Christian Tungesvik made a strong final push to clinch the bronze medal, passing Palici and his teammate Jon Sæverås Breivold on the last lap.</p>

<p>While Funk thus begins a completely new adventure, he also returns to his roots: as a five-year-old kid, Funk did his first triathlon at the Junior Challenge of Challenge Roth, where he immediately finished third. &#8220;Of course I have very special memories of Roth and only have positive associations with the race. I took my first triathlon steps in Roth in 2003, in my parents&#8217; “slipstream” so to speak, and it&#8217;s incredible to be returning to the long distance as a professional. I&#8217;ve been there almost every year so far and I&#8217;m looking forward to hopefully being able to experience the atmosphere in the ‘Home of Triathlon’ myself as a professional athlete. There was no question in my mind that my first long-distance triathlon would take place in Roth. I&#8217;m ready for the Roth experience.&#8221;</p>

The Brit announced his last year as a pro cyclist, but immediately announced his intention to do a Long Distance triathlon after that.</p>



<p>Only in 2025 can fans still enjoy Thomas in the peloton, because after this season he will thus stop as a pro cyclist. Thomas won the 2018 Tour de France and ended up riding as a pro rider for 19 years. Speaking to the BBC, he said he was immediately looking ahead to what follows after his career. “Since I was 17 or 18, I&#8217;ve worked towards a certain goal every year. I need a goal in life, otherwise I would just go crazy,” after which he said he was aiming for an Ironman participation.</p>



<p>“I only run two to three times a year now, so I still have a little work to do there. But I&#8217;d like to take on the challenge for myself, in multiple ways. It&#8217;s always good to have options. To not work toward a goal for once, maybe one month would be nice, but after that I&#8217;d go crazy.”</p>



<p>Which Ironman Thomas is aiming for &#8211; and when exactly &#8211; is not yet certain, but it is known that Thomas has a strong connection to his home country of Wales. Ironman therefore reacted immediately to the announcement of his retirement. “Ironman Wales is ready for you, when you are ready,” they said.</p>

Leading from start to finish, Phillips put on a masterclass of racing, showcasing his strength across all three disciplines.</p>



<p>Emerging from the swim in first place, Phillips wasted no time extending his advantage on the bike, powering through the scenic yet demanding course to build an unassailable lead. He continued his dominance on the run, crossing the finish line in 3 hours, 54 minutes, and 26 seconds with a 15-minute margin over his nearest rival.</p>



<p>Phillips said of the race, &#8220;It was great to get a hit out and come down and support the race” he took the opportunity to practice for next month’s full distance in Taupo.</p>



<p>Christchurch&#8217;s Tom Somerville took second, leaving everything out on the run course, stating he had &#8220;gone to some dark places on that run.&#8221; Local triathlete Laurie Watson secured third in an impressive race for the up-and-coming athlete, who started his journey with the Puzzling World Junior Challenge and today competed with the elites. Watson closed the gap to Somerville on the run, finishing only two seconds behind him.</p>



<p>In the women’s race, local Wanaka triathlete Danielle Donaldson continued her breakout season with a remarkable victory. Donaldson, who has delivered standout performances across multiple races this season, finished in 4 hours, 41 minutes, and 38 seconds. With consistent results in the age-group ranks, she is now considering transitioning to the professional field in 2025/2026.</p>



<p>Donaldson was chased down on the run by Deborah Lynch, the newly crowned 2025 Coast to Coast Champion, who finished second, 4 minutes and 28 seconds behind Donaldson. Another Wanaka Local and former professional triathlete, Maeve Kennedy-Birdsall, finished third.</p>



<p>A stunning day in Wanaka set the stage for this incredible event. The morning began with calm conditions and no wind for the swim start, but as the day progressed, the hot sun and challenging terrain took their toll on the athletes.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s fantastic to have athletes of Mike’s calibre supporting this year’s Gallagher Insurance Challenge Wanaka and testing out the course,&#8221; said Event Director Jane Sharman. &#8220;His performance today was impressive, and the feedback on the course has been invaluable. It’s a challenging course, and we&#8217;ve received positive suggestions on how it could be refined for the future. Overall, the vibe of the festival has been amazing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Challenge Wanaka continues to cement its reputation as one of the world&#8217;s most breathtaking and challenging Middle Distance triathlons, attracting top athletes and Age Group competitors. The 2025 event has once again showcased the passion, endurance, and camaraderie that make this race a standout on the international triathlon calendar.</p>

The race covered &#8211; per athlete &#8211; 300 meters of swimming, 7 kilometers of biking and 2 kilometers of running.</p>



<p>In the first heat it was pretty remarkable what a big deficit Germany was facing, and it was the same in the second heat. Initially the race was made especially hard by Belgium and USA, although the differences in the first heat were relatively small.</p>



<p>In the second heat that soon changed and a leading group emerged with the Netherlands, Portugal, Great Britain, Switzerland and Spain, but halfway through the bike, disaster struck in the leading group when Switzerland crashed and the three athletes behind crashed as well. Only Spain was able to avoid a crash and rode on, while Holland&#8217;s Mitch Kolkman got up at lightning speed and immediately went in pursuit again. Portugal, Great Britain and Switzerland suffered much more damage and were seen at this point.</p>



<p>From then on no large groups formed anymore and Germany, meanwhile, was catching up. That finally happened in the third heat, when it all came back together a bit at the front, but Tanja Neubert proved to be the strongest runner and took over the lead in the race for the first time. From then on, no one would see Germany again.</p>



<p>That in itself was remarkable, because in the fourth heat Henry Graf was leading, but was chased on the bike by The Netherlands, America, Italy and Spain. However, they did not close the gap to the front, but rather lost time: their gap grew from about fifteen to almost 35 seconds on the bike. When the run began, it was already clear that Germany would won the race.</p>



<p>Germany won the race in 1:32:05. America was second in 1:32:21 and Italy third in 1:32:24.</p>

Not the best triathlete — although I do recall him saying that he once clocked 23 minutes for a 1500m swim, which most of us would jump at. Running was less his forte.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When he completed the London Marathon last year by unconventional means (which I’ll come on to), he joked that it was likely the fastest way he would ever tackle the streets of the capital. But still, he was the strongest. And over the past five years, that strength only grew.</p>

<p>When I first met 37-year-old Sam Perkins in 2019, he could hardly breathe. He’d only received the diagnosis of motor neurone disease (MND) a few months earlier, but his lungs had packed up first, and he was using a ventilator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time I saw him for the last time at the start of this year, watching his beloved Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup tie from a bedroom he’d not been well enough to leave for three months, he could no longer move, talk, or eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eye recognition software helped him type out messages, a common one being ‘suction’ to clear out saliva. Sam never underplayed how MND strips a person physically because, in understanding its cruelty, we should only strive harder for a cure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not that it had been an unproductive week for Sam. Two days earlier, a cheque had been dropped off for £5,000 for Sam’s charity, <strong><a href=""https://standagainstmnd.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Stand Against MND</a></strong>, which he founded upon diagnosis and which continues to raise hundreds of thousands to help fund research at the University of Nottingham. </p>

<p>Triathlon and endurance sport had been the hook for his fundraising, a metaphor for his resilience. Make no mistake: Sam was the driving force, often with a fierce will that overruled more sensible judgement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, he wanted to be towed around in a boat and on a bike at the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/sam-perkins-this-is-my-chance-to-take-part-in-triathlon-just-one-more-time"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Outlaw in Nottingham in 2020</strong></a>. The pandemic put it on hold, and by the time that goal was realised, it had been scaled back to the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/sam-perkins-completes-one-more-tri-with-motor-neuron-disease"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Outlaw Half in 2022</strong></a>, with Sam being pushed for the run leg. </p>



<p>Covered in issue 405 of the 220Triathlon magazine, the team he assembled —family, friends, Nottingham Forest players — speaks to the esteem in which he was held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not sated by that, he was offered the chance to take part as a wheelchair-assisted athlete in the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/ironman-champ-chrissie-wellington-to-support-mnd-athlete-sam-perkins-in-london-marathon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>2023 London Marathon</strong></a>, where a buckled wheel on the adapted chair ultimately led to aborting the attempt after 15 miles. </p>

<p>He convinced us it was a good idea. It was. The day ended in a craft brewery, where Sam had a few sips of ale for one of the final times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfinished business meant a return to the London Marathon last year — and redemption. By now, the team had spare wheels, spare ventilators, and a supporting pram full of medical supplies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The merry band of family, runners, and carers that accompanied him made for a weekend to cherish. Tears of frustration were swapped for tears of joy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the aftermath, Sam channelled his emotions into <strong><a href=""https://standagainstmnd.com/blogs/standing-against-mnd"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">blog posts</a></strong> on the charity website— worth a few minutes of your time. </p>



<p>When I saw Sam for the final time, in his room in East Leake, with the world smaller now, I was more awestruck by his strength of human spirit than at any time previously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may remember that in her pro career, Chrissie Wellington sought inspiration from Rudyard Kipling’s <em>If</em>. When I hear that poem now, it is these four lines that will always remind me of Sam:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</p>



<p>To serve your turn long after they are gone</p>



<p>And so hold on when there is nothing in you</p>



<p>Except the Will which says to them:</p>



<p>‘Hold on!’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Perkins died on 9 February 2025 at home in East Leake. He was 43 years old.</p>

The Riel deal: From T100 triumph to a 2025 sequel?,https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/marten-van-riel-interview-2025,Liz Barrett,"Thu, 20 Feb 2025 10:19:48 +0000","['Athletes', 'News']","{'@isPermaLink': 'false', '#text': 'https://www.220triathlon.com/?p=168303'}","He’s Belgium’s Mr Consistent, and after a triumphant season on the new T100 circuit is now considered one of the world’s top middle-distance athletes. We caught up with Marten Van Riel as he gears up for his toughest year yet…",https://www.220triathlon.com/news/rss,"<p><strong>The 2024 race season was <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-marten-van-riel"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Marten Van Riel</a>’s year. Or at least it was on the T100 circuit, where the Belgian pro proved his mastery over the 100km race format, winning three races and finishing a close second to take the inaugural title and the $210k champion’s cheque at the final race. </strong></p>



<p>The 32-year-old had less luck elsewhere, most notably at his third and final <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/yees-belief-shines-through-for-paris-gold"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Olympics in Paris</a></strong>. After a sixth-place finish in Rio and an agonising fourth in <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/mens-olympic-triathlon-alex-yee-wins-silver-in-tokyo"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Tokyo</strong></a>, he was hoping for another solid result. Twenty-second was the best he could do on an unusual day for the sport that would propel him into the limelight in a way which he’d never imagined (more later). </p>



<p>And then there was Ironman Cozumel at the end of the year, where Van Riel (MVR) hoped to qualify for his first Worlds, just seven days after his T100 series victory. But after leading until 175km on the bike, Van Riel hit a pothole, swerved into the side of the road and hit a little girl who was spectating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Van Riel, despite suffering an elbow injury, completed the race but finished seventh, two places shy of Nice qualification. Luckily, after a trip to the local hospital, the girl was treated for a cut finger and took photos with Van Riel, who gave her his finisher’s medal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hoping for a more settled year, Van Riel knows he’ll also have his work cut out as a raft of big names joins the T100 roster for 2025. </p>



<p>But for now we find him in Girona, where he trains with Glenn Poleunis’s PTC Coaching outfit, as he reflects on that tumultuous 2024 and plans ahead for what promises to be another scintillating season…</p>

<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-the-news-has-just-broken-that-cassandra-beaugrand-will-be-joining-your-training-squad-this-year-what-are-you-hoping-to-learn-from-the-olympic-champion""><strong>220: The news has just broken that <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-cassandre-beaugrand"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Cassandra Beaugrand</a> will be joining your training squad this year. What are you hoping to learn from the Olympic champion?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>Yeah, it’s a really cool opportunity for all of us in the group to level up to the professionalism [that she brings]. It’s interesting seeing how all these athletes deal with being at that level and everything that comes with it. </p>



<p>I personally struggle sometimes to find some kind of stability in my life, so this is something that I think I can learn a lot from Cassandra.</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">

</ul>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-your-2024-was-also-incredibly-successful-and-you-would-have-had-a-clean-sweep-in-the-t100-were-it-not-for-your-compatriot-jelle-geens-won-lake-las-vegas-does-that-still-niggle""><strong>220: Your 2024 was also incredibly successful. And you would have had a clean sweep in the T100 were it not for your compatriot [Jelle Geens won Lake Las Vegas]. Does that still niggle?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR:</strong> Ha! Yeah, it stings a little but Jelle is a good friend of mine so I’m also happy for him. It was maybe also in a way good because I was getting a bit focused on that winning streak. </p>



<p>I knew that I was going to get beaten at some point, and that ‘loss’ gave me some more freedom, because while I don’t really care to lose a race, it’s sometimes also important. </p>



<p>And it was still a really good step towards the overall title, because with T100 it’s about who can be the most consistent over the year. And if you look at the field for next year, I hope, well unless it’s myself, I hope no one’s going to clean-sweep the whole series!</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/dubai-t100-grand-final-marten-van-riel-takes-win-and-world-title"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Marten Van Riel takes T100 world title</strong></a></li>
</ul>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-in-that-field-who-keeps-you-awake-at-night""><strong>220: In that field, who keeps you awake at night?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>I think the main guy will probably be <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-hayden-wilde"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Hayden</a> </strong>[Wilde]. At this distance, it’s getting harder to drop people on the swim because no one’s taking it out like they do in short course. </p>



<p>So Hayden is always going to be close and I think he’s shown that on the bike. And especially with some of the big firepower missing, like [Magnus] <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-magnus-ditlev"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Ditlev</strong></a>, which is something that I could always take advantage of, now maybe I’m gonna have to be the one that’s gonna push the bike. </p>



<p>And then on the run, Hayden did it [dropped back after a strong start] in Paris and again in Taupo [the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/ironman-70-3-world-championships-stacked-fields-as-worlds-best-head-to-taupo"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>2024 70.3 Worlds</strong></a>], but he’s going to get it right at some point and it’s going to be very hard for me to beat him on the run. And Jelle is also very, very fast, but I feel that’s very doable for me.</p>

<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-you-started-last-year-s-series-on-a-level-playing-ground-but-you-go-into-it-this-year-with-the-target-on-your-back-how-does-that-sit-with-you""><strong>220: You started last year’s series on a level playing ground, but you go into it this year with the target on your back. How does that sit with you?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>The level was always going to go up this year because last year there were a lot of Ironman guys who were really high in the PTO rankings, really good, solid athletes, but they were never going to be competitive in T100. </p>



<p>Maybe less than half the actual contracted field was actually competitive, whereas I think that this year nearly all of them are going to be competitive. So I know that everyone wants to take my title, but I just have to try and focus on myself.</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-you-did-four-out-of-the-six-t100-races-last-year-so-what-s-your-plan-this-year""><strong>220: You did four out of the six T100 races last year, so what’s your plan this year?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>We’re contracted to do five out of the 10 races [full schedule still to be announced], so I probably need to do seven to be competitive. </p>



<p>I’m going to do the first four and then if it goes really well in the beginning of the year, maybe I can scrap some of the races at the end and race something else.</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-and-are-you-still-hoping-to-qualify-for-the-ironman-worlds-in-nice""><strong>220: And are you still hoping to qualify for the Ironman Worlds in Nice?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR:</strong> Yes, I’m going to do Ironman South Africa at the end of March, which is a little bit complicated because we have to do Singapore T100 as part of our contract, which is the weekend after. It’s one of the races that I wanted to skip, so I might not have ‘it’ in Singapore. </p>



<p>But again, that’s the good thing about not having that winning streak anymore, I can be more comfortable with that. So I’m doing a bit more <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/long-distance/how-to-race-your-first-ironman"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Ironman preparation</strong></a> now and then also again after the French Riviera T100 [end of June], if I’m qualified.</p>

<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-what-was-your-t100-race-highlight-from-last-year-and-why""><strong>220: What was your T100 race highlight from last year and why?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR:</strong> <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/t100-san-francisco-van-riel-wins-epic-sprint-as-knibb-cruises-to-comfortable-win"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>San Francisco</strong></a>. I was the most unprepared there, which is why it makes me very happy that I could take the win. I’d done some Olympic qualification races just before it, so I had to travel a lot. </p>



<p>Afterwards I was thinking like, damn, that’s actually great that I pulled that off! I’ve raced<strong> <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/who-is-kyle-smith"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Kyle</a></strong> [Smith, who he narrowly beat at the tape] and Rico [Bogen, who came a close third] a lot more since and you can’t underestimate those guys. </p>



<p>And that race has always been on my bucket list since I was a kid reading 220! Escape from Alcatraz was mythical, it’s different from any other triathlon, so to be able to take my biggest ever win there, was amazing.</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-you-said-after-the-paris-games-that-you-didn-t-have-an-explanation-for-your-performance-six-months-on-do-you-have-one-now""><strong>220: You said after the Paris Games that you didn’t have an explanation for your performance. Six months on, do you have one now?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>Yeah, I still don’t really have an explanation to be honest. I think that maybe I did let myself go a little bit too much when they postponed the date, because I’ve heard some athletes say that they were prepared for it. And I 100% wasn’t. </p>



<p>I did not think that that was going to happen. Then I posted something on that day [about his disappointment with the organisers], that got a lot of people sending me messages, media from all over the world were contacting me, and I think that I just lost my focus. Other than that, I’m still not really sure because I think my run was in the best shape that it’s ever been. </p>



<p>It probably still wasn’t enough to beat <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-alex-yee"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Alex</strong></a> [Yee] or Hayden, but I think we also saw on that day that even they were vulnerable on the run. </p>



<p>But yeah, during my career I’ve always been so consistent and I don’t have many performances that I kind of don’t know why. Unfortunately this one, yeah, still no idea really.</p>

<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-does-that-mean-there-s-unfinished-business""><strong>220: Does that mean there’s unfinished business?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>Ha, no! When you come fourth it’s very hard to not want to come back. So maybe that’s the good thing about not coming fourth, fifth or sixth, now I’m kind of over it and I want to make a name in long distance. </p>



<p>It also just suits me a lot more. I still love the sport as much as when I was 18, before I was a pro. So I hope that I can still go for another eight to 10 years.</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-what-are-your-thoughts-now-on-how-the-olympic-triathlons-were-managed""><strong>220: What are your thoughts now on how the Olympic triathlons were managed?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR:</strong> I still think it’s very bad. In the end, the Olympic triathlon was a big success, and we saw way more interesting races then maybe I also expected. </p>



<p>The very strong current made the swim more decisive, because the swim just doesn’t break packs up anymore, whereas here it did. </p>



<p>But yeah everything around it, for me, that was a very bad experience. And one of our girls got sick, Claire Michel, so we didn’t race the mixed team relay. </p>



<p>I don’t even know if it was because of the river, because only a handful of people got sick. But I think the biggest thing was just the fact that they [the organisers] didn’t really seem to care. ‘Oh we’ll just do it the day later.’ </p>



<p>We’ve been training four years for this, and we’ve probably trained 5,000 hours of which probably 1,500 are swimming. They really can’t have that happen again because it just makes a joke out of the athletes.</p>

<p>&#8220;On June 29th, 2020 my life changed forever. While walking into my barbershop for a routine haircut, I was shot three times in a drive-by shooting. The night of the shooting I was given a 50/50 shot to make it through the night because of the blood loss. I was told even if I did make it, the odds were high they would need to amputate my leg.  </p>

<p>&#8220;My doctors told me I’d never walk or run properly again. A neurologist even said I’d never run a <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/run-training/how-to-run-your-first-marathon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">marathon</a></strong>—so I ran a <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/run-training/whats-a-good-half-marathon-time"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>half-marathon</strong> </a>right after that appointment. Humans are capable of far more than we give ourselves credit for.</p>



<p>&#8220;After being shot, I leaned on my friends. They didn’t coddle me, they held me accountable and inspired me to grow. Surrounding yourself with people who genuinely want to see you thrive can change your life.</p>

<p>&#8220;<strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/how-to-train-for-your-first-triathlon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Triathlon training</a></strong> constantly reminds me what I’m capable of and pushes me to keep striving for more. Training for three disciplines keeps things exciting, even if it’s not necessarily easier on my body. I’ve never been a <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/swim-training/what-makes-triathlons-strongest-swimmers-so-fast"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">strong swimmer</a></strong>, and until late November, I hadn’t learned to swim properly. Tackling something new and challenging is incredibly rewarding.</p>



<p>&#8220;Without big goals, I lack discipline. Ironman training forces me to improve not just in fitness but also in time management, which positively impacts my work, relationships, and overall life.</p>



<p>&#8220;I chose <strong>Ironman</strong> because it is coming to my hometown, Ottawa—the place where I was born, raised, and shot. After the shooting, I vowed to run a marathon despite nearly losing my right leg. </p>

<p>&#8220;I trained for my first two marathons on the same course Ironman will use. It’s where I rebuilt my confidence, made lifelong friends, and became the person I am today. </p>



<p>&#8220;My goal is to raise $200,000 for trauma survivors, giving back to the community that shaped me. My best friend, a physiotherapist, is the reason I’m able to train for this Ironman today. </p>



<p>&#8220;He spent 3–5 hours a day with me, not just helping me heal, but making me stronger than ever. This effort is an homage to him and a way to ensure others have access to the same quality care.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that with the right resources and care, many individuals who end up on lifelong disability support could instead find their new 100%. I want to be part of that change.</p>



<p>&#8220;The <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/beginners/what-are-the-benefits-of-triathlon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">triathlon community</a></strong> is incredibly supportive. I’ve had famous athletes, influencers, and world champions reach out with advice and encouragement. It’s truly a one-of-a-kind tribe where everyone wants to see each other succeed. </p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone has a story. Whether it’s overcoming trauma like me, or simply a drive to be extraordinary, it’s inspiring to be surrounded by people chasing something bigger than themselves.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can’t control what happens to you, but you can control how you respond. I couldn’t control whether I survived the night I was shot, but I could control my recovery. </p>



<p>&#8220;By focusing on rebuilding myself <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/what-are-the-best-strength-training-exercises-for-triathletes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>stronger</strong> </a>and using my story for good, I not only healed but gave hope to my family and friends during a difficult time. Taking accountability for my healing allowed us all to move forward without being weighed down by bitterness or regret.&#8221; </p>

WTCS Abu Dhabi: Germans grab comeback win as Brits crash out,https://www.220triathlon.com/news/wtcs-abu-dhabi-german-grab-comeback-win-as-brits-crash-out,Tim Heming,"Sun, 16 Feb 2025 11:28:49 +0000",News,"{'@isPermaLink': 'false', '#text': 'https://www.220triathlon.com/?p=168070'}","An inexperienced German quartet recovered from last place in a dramatic mixed team relay, but it was heartbreak for GB when in contention for the podium.",https://www.220triathlon.com/news/rss,"<p><strong>Germany’s Midas touch in the mixed team relay continued as its young team somehow pulled off victory in Abu Dhabi.</strong></p>



<p>The Olympic and world champions’ hopes looked to be dashed early as they struggled at the rear of the field halfway through the second leg.</p>



<p>But a bike crash that took out Great Britain’s Max Stapley, along with Portugal’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-vasco-vilaca"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Vasco Vilaca</a> and Switzerland’s Simon Westermann, helped bring them back into contention before a stellar final leg from Henry Graf sealed the win.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-morgan-pearson"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Morgan Pearson</a> brought the USA in for second place, and 20-year-old Euan De Nigro rounded out the podium for Italy.</p>



<p>It was an unfortunate end to British hopes after Beth Cook had put them in a strong position on the first leg, and then Stapley, alongside the powerful Vilaca, looked set to capitalise on the advantage.</p>



<p>Yet, when Westermann slid out on a corner, bringing down another three of the leading five, everything changed — including putting the Swiss, Portuguese and Brits out of the race.</p>



<p>There were already no French, Australians or New Zealanders competing, but following entertaining <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/wtcs-abu-dhabi-lisa-tertsch-leads-german-women-podium-sweep"">women’s </a>and <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/wtcs-abu-dhabi-hayden-wilde-powers-to-victory-in-season-opener"">men’s races</a> the previous day, 11 nations did line up, including <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/olympics/paris-triathlon-team-germany-win-gold-in-the-mixed-team-relay-as-team-gb-take-bronze"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">all three Olympic medallists</a>: Germany, USA and Great Britain.</p>



<p>With only one other mixed team relay competition taking place in this year’s World Triathlon Championship Series, in Hamburg in July, it provided a rare opportunity for athletes to show their mettle over the super-sprint format.</p>



<p>While the distances stayed the same, in a change to the ordering for the next four years, the men reverted to competing on the anchor leg, as was the case up to and including the Tokyo Olympics.</p>



<p>The Germans, who also defended their mixed team relay world title in 2024 and had won the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/olympics/team-germany-win-the-paris-olympics-mixed-relay-test-event"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Paris Olympics relay test event</a> the year before, weren’t alone in fielding a novice quartet.</p>



<p>Portugal was one of the few to buck that trend, fielding three of the Paris Olympic team, including Vilaca and Ricardo Batista, who had already shown they were in good form, having finished third and sixth in the individual event.</p>



<p>Britain’s four were led off by Cook, followed by Stapley, with both Isobella Hayes and Hugo Milner unable to take part after Stapley crashed out.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-leg-1"">What happened on Leg 1?</h3>



<p>If any reminder was needed of how fast the racing is, Belgium’s Jolien Vermeylen led out the opening 300m swim in a touch over four minutes.</p>



<p>Britain’s Cook, daughter of 1989 world championship runner-up Glenn Cook and multiple European champion Sarah Coope, was in close attendance in transition, and a leading group of five quickly formed for the 7km bike leg.</p>



<p>USA’s Taylor Spivey, who was 13th in the individual race in Abu Dhabi, took over the lead for the more technical sections, but with half the chasers catching on, it left the Dutch, Germans and Irish a few seconds adrift.</p>



<p>There was little to split the field as they headed out onto the 2km run, with the biggest surprise being that Germany’s Selina Klamt was dropping further and further behind.</p>



<p>Vermeylen and Spain’s Anna Godoy were first to hand over, with the top eight within 20sec, but the Germans 43sec back and, along with Ireland and Japan, looking almost out of contention.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-leg-2"">What happened on Leg 2?</h3>



<p>Stapley brought the Brits back into the lead with a typically strong swim and set off on the bike with the talented Vilaca, Netherlands’ Mitch Kolkmann, Switzerland’s Westermann and Spain’s David Cantero.</p>



<p>Just as the breakaway looked as if it might be race-defining, there was another twist as news filtered through of 10-second penalties for both the Portuguese and the Spanish.</p>



<p>Disaster then struck the lead group just before they hit the athletics track, as on a painted section of road, Westermann slid out at the front, bringing down three of the other front five, leaving only Cantero still riding.</p>



<p>Kolkmann remounted to haul in the Spaniard and fly past, but it was race over for Westermann, Stapley and Vilaca.</p>



<p>USA, Belgium and Italy all came into transition 30sec behind, with Germany, Japan and Ireland another 20 sec in arrears as the gaps started to close.</p>



<p>Cantero reeled Kolkmann in halfway through the run, tagging Miriam Casillas for the third leg with the Spanish in with a chance of a rare podium finish.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-leg-3"">What happened on Leg 3?</h3>



<p>There were 55sec covering the remaining eight nations as the relay passed its midpoint, with Netherlands’ Luna De Bruin bridging up to Casillas at the front of the swim.</p>



<p>The Italians had Bianca Seregni, who led out the previous day’s swim in the individual event, on the third leg, which helped close up the race once more as they headed out on the bikes.</p>



<p>USA’s Erika Ackerlund and Belgium’s Nele Dequae were working together in third and fourth to try to keep the front pair in sight, and there was a similar gap back to the four chasers: Italy, Germany, Japan and Ireland.</p>



<p>Irish triathlete Hollie Elliott, who had recently switched from GB, lost a chunk of time towards the end of the bike leg, which looked to have ended her nation’s chances.</p>



<p>Casillas was sharpest away on the run and decided to use her advantage to serve the outstanding 10sec penalty, rejoining the race in third place and leaving Germany’s Tanja Neubert in the lead.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-leg-4"">What happened on Leg 4?</h3>



<p>Henry Graf had a 9sec advantage over USA’s Morgan Pearson for the final leg, with Italy’s Euan De Nigro, Spain’s Roberto Sanchez Mantecon and Netherlands’ Gjalt Panjer in pursuit.</p>



<p>Graf extended the lead by another 4sec after the swim and had a decision to make — whether to go all-out on the bike or save his energy, knowing there was likely to be a chasing pack of four, including the fast-running Pearson.</p>



<p>The German had no intention of sitting up and continued to build a gap as he started the final bike lap. Unrest was setting in over sharing the workload to hunt Graf down, and as he headed onto the run, the lead looked unassailable.</p>



<p>While the gap came down over the final stage, Graf rarely looked in danger, and Pearson eased clear of De Nigro, with Sanchez Mantecon just missing out on the podium.</p>

<p>Wilde, who picked up Olympic silver in Paris and then won the WTCS Championship Finals in Spain, kicked away from Australia’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-matt-hauser"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Matt Hauser</a> in the closing stages over the sprint distance in the Middle East.</p>



<p>Portugal’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-vasco-vilaca"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Vasco Vilaca</a> grabbed a hard-earned third place, with Britain’s Ben Dijkstra, on his WTCS debut, finishing eighth, Max Stapley, 11th, and Harry Leleu 15th.</p>



<p>After a cancellation on the eve of last year’s competition due to an impending storm, the triathletes were just pleased to get racing on a typically hot day in the Middle East.</p>



<p>While Abu Dhabi has become the traditional curtain-raiser for the season for the past decade, a February race was a month earlier than usual &#8211; and the earliest that a WTCS event has ever been scheduled.</p>



<p>With the next event not being until May in Japan, it meant several of the big names were missing including reigning world champion <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-alex-yee"">Alex Yee </a>&#8211; who was concentrating on his London Marathon preparations for April &#8211; and the French contingent of 2022 and 2023 world champs, Leo Bergere and Dorian Coninx.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-in-the-swim"">What happened in the swim?</h3>



<p>Olympic silver medallist Wilde was ranked No 1 of the starters and was a clear favourite for victory.</p>



<p>But next best in the 2024 rankings, Australia’s Hauser, is a renowned swimmer, and the Gold Coast native was very familiar with the beach start format adopted in the Middle East.</p>



<p>As such, Hauser led the swim from the hooter, with a line of athletes content to swim in his wake starting with Brazil’s Miguel Hidalgo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hauser, who crashed out of last year’s WTCS finals in Spain, produced a rare sub-8min swim, with Hidalgo following and then Portugal’s Miguel Tiago Silva and Germany’s Henry Graf.</p>



<p>The best placed Brits out of the water were Dijkstra (9th), Leleu (11th) and Stapley (15th). Wilde was 32nd out of the water, 29sec behind.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-the-bike"">What happened on the bike?</h3>



<p>The pace was on from the start with the front group of 16, including the leading three Brits, making a small gap of 6sec on the chasers led by Wilde.</p>



<p>The wind was fierce in places, buffeting them as they rode over the short bridge section, and then pushing them to more than 50km/h as they headed back towards the athletics track.</p>



<p>By the time they completed the second lap, the main groups were back together, but Wilde wasn’t content to let that be the end of the action.</p>



<p>The Kiwi continued to try and forge a break at the front and in Switzerland’s Simon Westermann and Austria’s Tjebbe Kaindl found two willing accomplices.</p>



<p>Heading onto the final lap the leading trio had established a gap that only served to give them a clearer run into the second transition as the main group dismounted within seconds of one another.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-the-run"">What happened on the run?</h3>



<p>A group of five set about making the pace on the first of the two laps for the 5km run. Hauser, Wilde, Vilaca were all present along with Netherlands’ Mitch Kolkmann and Canada’s Charles Paquet.</p>



<p>Kolkmann and Paquet were quickly jettisoned, and Vilaca, who placed fifth in the Paris Olympics, dropped off towards the end of the first lap.</p>



<p>Wilde and Hauser took turns at the front as they approached the closing stages, but it always looked likely that Wilde would go through the gears at some stage, and when he did, Hauser couldn’t quite match it.</p>



<p>Dijkstra was a few seconds away from fourth place, but eventually had to settle for eighth, with Stapley and Leleu also having decent showings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t Hugo Milner’s day though. Having lost touch on the bike, the fast-running Milner finished in 31st place and just over 2min off the pace.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-wilde-said"">Wilde said:</h3>



<p>“It feels like this is my second home as I’ve been here three-to-four weeks and have been loving it. We got a breakaway [on the bike], it didn’t stick, but we had fun out there. I’ve raced Matt over 5km many times and I knew for sure he had one more push. He was coming hot, and I was happy to hold on. I don’t know how many World Series I&#8217;ll do, but it was nice to win here for the first time. T100 is up next in Singapore, so I’m looking forward to racing the long course boys.”</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-hauser-said"">Hauser said:</h3>



<p>“It’s always tough getting second, especially when you’re there the whole way. I kept saying to myself: ‘Stay in the game!’ There were a few tactics and games [from Wilde] but I managed to hold on for second. I can’t wait for the next one, and I’m looking forward to the World Championship Finals and hopefully bringing it home on home soil.”</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-vilaca-said"">Vilaca said:</h3>



<p>“I’m very happy with third place. It’s the first race of the session, and a&nbsp; great start. These guys made me suffer today and I think the legs have woken up and are ready to get into 2025. I loved the course. The F1 course is legendary but this whole island is beautiful and I’m stoked to be here. Now it’s time to put some good work in for Yokohama.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old justified her top billing by sprinting to victory from team-mates <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-nina-eim"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Nina Eim</a> and <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-laura-lindemann"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Laura Lindemann</a> in the first of the seven-race series that culminates in the Championship Finals in Wollongong, Australia in October.</p>



<p>France’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-leonie-periault"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Leonie Periault</a> finished in fourth place, with another German, Tanja Neubert, in fifth. Britain’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-kate-waugh"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Kate Waugh</a> opened up her season with 10th place, having been one of the aggressors during the bike leg.</p>



<p>It was an early starter to the World Triathlon Championship Series, which meant that many of the main contenders, including reigning world champion <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-cassandre-beaugrand"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Cassandre Beaugrand</a> and Britain’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-beth-potter"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Beth Potter</a> chose to skip the event.</p>



<p>That did present an opportunity for others to step up, with Germany’s two Olympic mixed team relay gold medallists Tertsch and Lindemann both among the favourites.</p>



<p>So too were Luxembourg’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-jeanne-lehair"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jeanne Lehair</a>, France’s Periault and Britain’s Waugh, who was the only GB triathlete racing, in contrast to eight pro women from Germany. </p>



<p>Another noticeable name was 2016 Olympic champion <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-gwen-jorgensen"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Gwen Jorgensen</a>. The 38-year-old missed out on selection for the Paris Olympics but did finish 2024 with a World Cup win, the second tier of racing, in Japan. </p>



<p>The veteran also had more WTCS podiums than the rest of the field combined, but having struggled to stay in contention on the bike leg, she would eventually finish 29th and more than 2min back.</p>



<p>Alongside Hamburg, Abu Dhabi was one of only two sprint races on the 2025 WTCS calendar, but in a change to the scoring system for this season, sprint races were given equal weighting with standard distance events.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-in-the-swim"">What happened in the swim?</h3>



<p>It was a changed course for the 2025 event that would no longer use the Formula 1 circuit for the bike and run legs, and the early afternoon non-wetsuit swim was a 750m out and back dash from a beach start.</p>



<p>Bianca Seregni made an early break on the left-handed course, and with Belgium’s Jolien Vermeylen for company had clear water on the rest of the field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Italian has proven her calibre in the swim over recent years, but her bike-run combination is also improving, as shown by a career-best eighth place finish in last year’s WTCS finals in Torremolinos-Andalucia.</p>



<p>Seregni was first into transition in 8:56, closely followed by Vermeylen, with USA’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-taylor-spivey"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Taylor Spivey</a>, who has also signed a T100 contract for 2025, leading the rest of the field, 18sec behind.</p>



<p>Germany’s Tertsch and Lindemann were also in close attendance, with Jorgensen at 30sec and Waugh slightly further back than she’d have wanted in 29th place and 35sec in arrears.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-the-bike"">What happened on the bike?</h3>



<p>The 20km bike leg featured five flat and fast laps that included a couple of tight chicanes.</p>



<p>Seregni and Vermeylen’s lead didn’t last a lap with almost the entire field coming together by the time they reached the athletics track, with the numbers contributing to a crash towards the rear of the field involving Italy’s Verena Steinhauser and Spain’s Miriam Casillas García.</p>



<p>Jorgensen was struggling to stick with the pace, and on lap three Waugh turned up the heat even more with the first significant breakaway of the afternoon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The field came back together on lap four, but it was whittled down to fewer than 30 athletes, before Waugh led them to the second transition at 38:01.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-the-run"">What happened on the run?</h3>



<p>After Waugh’s initial burst, it was a large group that headed out onto the two-lap 5km run with a trio of Germans at the front.</p>



<p>Eim, Lehair and Periault all took turns to lead, and as they headed onto the final lap, it was the Frenchwoman surrounded by Germans, Lindemann, Eim and Tertsch who were vying for the podium.</p>



<p>With a headwind on different parts of the course, there were some tactical moves, but Tertsch seized the initiative with a few hundred metres and stormed down the blue carpet for victory in 54:28, followed by Eim and then Lindemann for a German podium sweep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Periault finished fourth, with Mexico’s Rosa Maria Tapia Vidal in fifth, as Waugh managed to hold on for a top 10.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-tertsch-said"">Tertsch said:</h3>



<p>“It was a great race and I’mn very happy with the way I executed it, but I also prepared really well. It was cat and mouse on the last lap on the run, but that’s racing and everyone has to play their cards. Last year was a very exciting year with many firsts and I learnt a lot, and I’ll take those lessons into this year.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-eim-said"">Eim said:</h3>



<p>“It’s really a dream come true to get on the podium &#8211; and I achieved it in the first race of the season. I couldn’t have expected a better start and told myself the whole time: ‘You can do this, you can do this!’ The last kilometre was really hard, but I gave it everything I had and I was so happy that I got second.”</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-lindemann-said"">Lindemann said:</h3>



<p>“That was a really tough race, warm and very fast and I was feeling the pain after the season break. It’s always a shock for the body, but a lot of fun too. We tried to stay focused at the front of the bike and not risk a crash in a big group and I think we did a good job. The whole run smashed me in the end, there was not much left for a good sprint finish, but I’m super happy to complete a historic German podium.”</p>

<p>Capturing headlines were the dramatic challenges along the way though. Cook was robbed at gunpoint and struggled with both injury and food poisoning, as well as brutal conditions during the run – which aimed to raise £1 million for his chosen charities.</p>



<p>The new challenge will see Cook attempt to run the length of the 3000km Te Araroa, a mountainous trail which spans the length of New Zealand.  Te Araroa is famed as having some of the world’s most diverse terrains, with mountains, native forests, coastlines, seas and cities to navigate. </p>



<p>This March, during New Zealand’s autumn, Russ will take off from Stirling Point in Bluff at the southern tip of the South Island, and run northbound, equivalent to 60 ultramarathons, before crossing the finish line in Cape Rēinga in Northland.</p>

<p>The 10 pairs in this grouptest range from entry- level options, invariably with nylon soles and basic synthetic uppers, through to high-end shoes with full carbon or carbon-injected soles for more stiffness. </p>



<p>The latter will also have more technical uppers designed to hug your foot perfectly while being breathable enough for warm rides. All shoes are unisex, and our test pairs are all size 45.</p>

<p>There’s substance to match the style on these fantastic earthy grey/green R4 Tempo Overcurves; the name referring to the asymmetric shape that Fizik says better conforms to your foot, which I agree provided a superb fit.</p>



<p>The single BOA IP1 dial was plenty enough to get fast and secure closure, with the staggered ‘collar’ of the shoe wrapping around my ankles perfectly.</p>



<p>The upper is very robust and stood up to every type of weather I could throw at it. Fizik claims the polyurethane-laminated material layered over the top of comfy mesh should also reduce energy loss and provide extra support.</p>



<p>The carbon-injected sole is rated seven out of 10 for stiffness, which Fizik says is at home on weekend group rides, daily training or gran fondos.</p>

<p>British multisport brand Sundried claims these affordable kicks will be ‘the best cycle shoes you’ve ever owned’, and while that wasn’t to be the case, for the price they’re adequate for your off-season training.</p>



<p>Weighing just over 300g per shoe on my scales the fit is quite narrow, which meant there wasn’t much room for my toes at the front of the shoe. But the two-way edging at the back cupped my heels securely. </p>



<p>This made up for a bit of a struggle getting them tight, as I found the dial slipped a little against the quite flimsy tongue.</p>



<p>Ventilation is good with some small mesh sections and strategically-placed holes providing plenty of breathability, while the insole also has drainage holes for a quick-drying ride. Finally, the soles aren’t overly stiff, with a bit of flex evident on big inclines.</p>

<ul class=""wp-block-list"">

</ul>



<p>DMT claimed to have produced the first bike shoe with a fully knitted upper back in 2018 and the same tech features throughout here. </p>



<p>The KR3 model sits below the KR1 and new range-topping KR0, yet still features a carbon sole and knit technology to bring the weight down to a feathery 250g per shoe.</p>



<p>Like the <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/bike-shoes/dmt-kt1-triathlon-shoe-review/"">KT1 triathlon shoes</a></strong>, one BOA IP1 dial felt adequate for tightening as the upper really hugs your foot in the right places. </p>



<p>DMT credits its technical yarns with variable thicknesses for the sock-like sensation you feel in the KR3, and on test rides my feet were happy over many miles.</p>



<p>A super-stiff full carbon sole makes them race ready, and in the rain the knit dries fairly quickly, though I&#8217;d hesitate to use them in really bad weather. </p>



<p>If I could budget for a luxury summer road shoe, the KR3 would be near the top of my list.</p>

<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>£85</strong> (UK only)</li>
</ul>



<p>With a full carbon sole, two adjustable dials and plenty of ventilation for just £85, the Boardman Carbon seems almost too good to be true. And although it’s not the most luxurious-looking, my reservations were unfounded as this shoe is the real deal.</p>



<p>The sole isn’t as stiff as the higher-grade carbon found on offerings from Le Col and DMT, but it dealt with everything I threw at it during testing. There’s venting in the soles and plenty of holes on the synthetic upper.</p>



<p>They’re not the most breathable and I&#8217;d perhaps ask for a little more venting on the upper, but they’re fine for mild and warm weather. </p>



<p>Two ATOP dials allow you to get the ideal amount of tension, while the tongue wraps around the foot nicely. These shoes bear the name of a gold medal-winning Olympic legend, and they deservedly take the top spot on the podium in this grouptest of the best road bike shoes.</p>

</ul>



<p>Aimed more at sportives and training rather than all-out racing, Bontrager’s Velocis is one of the lightest shoes on test at just 243g each on my scales. </p>



<p>The sole is a carbon/fibreglass composite, which provides a medium stiffness that will be fine for everyday training and fast commuting.</p>



<p>Equipped with a BOA IP1 dial and additional Velcro strap for easy adjustability, the tongue underneath the closure system is quite thick, making my midfoot feel a little claustrophobic.</p>



<p>The perforated upper aims to ‘allow for increased breathability and comfort’, however I&#8217;d ideally have liked some mesh sections to enhance the breathability, as on hot days my feet overheated slightly. </p>



<p>If you find too much shoe stiffness harsh going but are after the lightest and affordable option possible, then the Velocis will fit the bill.</p>

<p>The Motion is the cheapest shoe on test and also in Bont’s range. So what’s missing? </p>



<p>First up, there’s no heat-mouldable chassis like you’ll find on Bont’s other shoes. And there are just three Velcro straps supplied to tension the shoe, which is acceptable at this price point but just don’t work as well as dials.</p>



<p>Strap styles are also starting to look a bit dated. But otherwise, there’s only good things to say about this shoe. The fibreglass sole is impressively stiff, and the profile is low which makes you feel really connected to the pedals.</p>



<p>They’re also very roomy, so will suit those with wide feet, and there’s plenty of ventilation throughout. </p>



<p>If you’re just starting your triathlon journey and really want a do-it-all shoe, the wide opening you can get from fully loosening the straps would also be useful for swift triathlon transitions.</p>

<p>Giro’s Regime has a unique upper made from what the brand calls ‘ultralight monofilament mesh Synchwire’. </p>



<p>It’s noticeably different to many of the other shoes on test, which have more standard synthetic uppers, but we found it very light and airy, although a little less resistant to wet weather.</p>



<p>Two BOA L6 dials are appreciated at this price-point, providing a secure fit throughout testing. </p>



<p>The composite sole was noticeably stiffer than the entry-level shoes on test, and the extra 5mm of adjustment in the cleat fixings is a nice extra touch.</p>



<p>Though the toebox is narrow, I found the midfoot-to-heel section unusually wide, meaning I had to adjust my cleats slightly to avoid the inside of the shoe brushing my cranks. </p>



<p>Although I couldn’t quite get on with the Regime’s shape, it’s still feature-packed with some impressive upper innovation.</p>

</ul>



<p>Decathlon’s in-house cycling brand Van Rysel has delivered some quality bargains since its inception, and the ROADR520 is one of them.</p>



<p>Its one ATOP dial with an additional Velcro strap provides enough tension, but the composite sole will be better suited to those who find full carbon too rigid.</p>



<p>The upper is very comfortable, especially the tongue that feels soft against the foot. Underneath you’ll find holes for two and three bolt cleats, the former being useful if you want to use them for commuting.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the two-bolt insert came loose during testing which created an annoying rattle, but with some bodging I got it secure.</p>



<p>You miss out on some extra cleat fore/aft offered by some of the pricier shoes on test, but otherwise I found few compromises. If you want an affordable pair for year-round use, the ROADR 520 should be considered.</p>

<ul class=""wp-block-list"">

</ul>



<p>The Torch 1.0 is the most wallet-friendly road shoe from Specialized, with a stiffness rating of six out of 15 on the Specialized stiffness scale. </p>



<p>But it’s also one of the heaviest on test at 327g per shoe, with the quite bulky synthetic upper and lining adding to the few extra grams, yet proving to be sturdy and secure over the test period.</p>



<p>A BOA L6 dial with additional Velcro strap secures the shoe, spreading the pressure across the foot adequately, and I found the nylon sole more flexible than I&#8217;m used to on very hard sprint efforts.</p>



<p>Like Sundried’s offering, there’s nothing wrong with the Torch 1.0, and it performed as I expected for a shoe at the £100 price point, but there are no absolute standout features. Instead, you’re getting a functional training shoe that will do the job.</p>

<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li><strong>£275 / $350</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The Le Col Pro Carbon has a full unidirectional carbon sole which proved the stiffest on test – not unsurprisingly as it’s the most expensive offering. </p>



<p>There wasn’t a hint of flex to be found, which means maximum power transfer for sprints and climbs.</p>



<p>The upper is the only on test to be made from PU leather and although the shiny looks aren’t for everyone, it’s practical because you can just wipe the dirt straight off after rides in adverse weather conditions.</p>



<p>The kicks are also very comfortable and didn’t fold or crease when I tightened the two ATOP dials. Plenty of holes and mesh sections offer enough breathability, although I did find my feet got a little sweatier under the PU than some of the lighter synthetic uppers on test.</p>



<p>These shoes are also light at 270g each on our scales, and worth the outlay if you’re after a pair for racing as well as off-season training.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-best-road-bike-shoes-our-overall-verdict""><strong>Best road bike shoes: Our overall verdict</strong></h2>



<p>With the road cycling shoes on test spanning a wide range of price points, we judged each pair primarily on their own merits, while ensuring quality, value and standout features were factored into the equation.</p>



<p>Thankfully none were bad, with shoes from Bontrager, Giro and Le Col finding themselves lower down the list for their higher prices compared to the competition. </p>



<p>Fizik’s Tempo Overcurve is pushing £200, but achieved a higher score thanks to the quality construction and suitability for year-round use, while DMT’s KR3 impressed us with its unique knitted technology.</p>



<p>Niche yes, but still a top performer. Sundried’s debut road shoe is better than average for £90, but has been pitched against three of the best budget road shoes in the Boardman Carbon, Van Rysel ROADR 520 and Bont Motion.</p>



<p>While the Boardman isn’t the out-and-out best or most luxurious cycling shoe money can buy, for the price it can’t be beaten. </p>



<p>You’ll usually spend north of £200 before you get carbon soles and multiple dials, but Boardman has ticked both boxes on a shoe costing just £85, rightfully earning it ‘best on test’.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>How we tested</strong></h2>



<p>All of the road bike shoes featured here have been tested by former <em>220 Triathlon</em> staff writer and current Road.cc editor Jack Sexty.</p>



<p>Each shoe has been tested on a range of rides including steady long sessions and rides with intense climbing or sprinting.</p>



<p>During testing, Jack analysed each shoe against a range of criteria including stiffness and power transfer, comfort, weight, breathability, value and fit.</p>



<p>Anything that scores over 90% is genuinely top-class, while a score of 80-90% also represents a road bike shoe that comes very highly recommended.</p>



<p>Scores between 70-80% mean the shoe may have a couple of flaws, but still has a lot of positives, while anything below 70% means we weren&#8217;t overly impressed and proceed with caution.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-to-look-for-in-the-best-road-bike-shoes"">What to look for in the best road bike shoes </h2>



<p>Within the road shoe category, there are numerous variations depending on what you’re primarily using them for.</p>



<p>Those made to excel on climbs and in warm weather will have light, airy uppers with an emphasis on keeping the weight down, while shoes designed to hack winter weather will have tougher, synthetic, sometimes even leather, uppers.</p>



<p>Of course, for temperatures in single digits it’s extremely wise to add thermal overshoes on top to keep your feet toasty, no matter what type of shoe you go for.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Closure system</h3>



<p>Some road bike shoes will have large velcro straps like triathlon bike shoes, but other <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/bike-shoes/laces-velcro-or-twist-lock-cycling-shoes-which-is-best""><strong>cycling shoe closure mechanisms</strong> </a>are more common. Boa dials and laces look sleeker and offer more adjustment.<br></p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Heel tab</h3>



<p>Although you shouldn’t walk too far in cycling cleats, a heel tab or bumper is good to have when you do have to put your foot down. It provides grip lacking on slippery carbon soles and protects&nbsp; them from scuffs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More premium models will have screw-in, replaceable heel bumpers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Sole</h3>



<p>Sole material will influence how stiff the shoe feels as you pedal. Glass fibre is the flexiest option, usually found on cheaper cycling shoes. Pricier models will use super-stiff full carbon. Mid-range options tend to mix the two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies suggest a stiffer sole doesn’t improve power transfer. But some riders find a stiffer sole more comfortable and supportive.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Cleat position</h3>



<p>Adjustable cleat bolt holes are a handy feature, if you’re prepared to pay extra for it. This means you can move the cleats further back, as many bike fitters recommend.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Ventilation</h3>



<p>If you ride indoors or in warm weather, you’ll want ventilation. Perforated, mesh uppers and sole vents will keep your feet cooler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some shoes take breathability too warm for winter riding though, even when covered in overshoes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Fit</h3>



<p>Many cyclists wear ill-fitting road bike shoes. We’d recommend trying them on before buying if you can. Or even better, book a shoe-fitting appointment at a <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/injuries/triathlon-bike-fit""><strong>quality bike fitter</strong>.</a>  </p>



<p>Many bike fitters will discount the shoe-fitting service if you buy a pair from them. And some have all the main brands available to purchase.&nbsp;</p>","{'@xmlns': 'com-wordpress:feed-additions:1', '#text': '91145'}",https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/bike-shoes/best-road-bike-shoes-reviewed#respond,https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/bike-shoes/best-road-bike-shoes-reviewed/feed,0,

A sprint distance is fun, fast and great preparation for a longer upcoming race. When the distances start to get longer the type of speed training required to dial in your race effort also change.</p>
<p>With different run distances training choices can get complicated. How to train for a fast 5km run is different than training for a solid half marathon. Even though the training fundamentals are similar for all running distances in triathlon, there are a few key workouts for each one that can help you nail the demands of your next sprint, standard or long distance race.</p>
<h2>Build your base first</h2>
<p>Initially, athletes should focus on building a solid endurance base by gradually increasing the duration of their long runs week-to week. Building a base is essential for any distance. For a shorter race like a sprint triathlon you should aim to build your long run to an hour. Standard distance triathlons require a running base of an hour minimally, and up to an hour and a half is recommended.</p>

<p>For the half and full Ironman distances you should be able to get in at least two hours continuously on your feet, whether that&#8217;s at a run or a combination of running and walking. Many athletes go beyond this duration, but it is best to get trusted advice from a coach or expert to determine what is right for you.</p>
<h2>Get specific to dial in your race goals</h2>
<p>When it comes to performance, the training must go beyond the base building easy runs. The demands of a fast 5km requires intentional short speed work that targets the upper end of your cardiovascular system and running economy. A 10km demands less speed, so the training should include more threshold work held for a longer duration.</p>
<p>When the distance extends to the half marathon it becomes a combination of tempo and endurance work. The same is true for marathon training. Both should continue to include short speed and threshold work, but it&#8217;s also important to add race pace sessions near tempo, or the top end of your endurance and race pace.</p>
<p>To help you maximize your performance at the different run distances for each triathlon, here are four key workouts.</p>

<p>Strides: 5x20s on 40s rest &#8211; building speed (still part of the warm up. Fast but not all out to prime turnover in the legs)</p>
<p>Hard (Zone 4-5): 10x 2-3min at threshold pace on 1min rest. Aim for the hardest pace you can run, but also maintain for all 10 repetitions. Avoid starting too hard and fizzling out. The goal is &#8220;best hard pace&#8221; for the full duration of the main set.</p>
<p>Cool down: 10 min easy running or walking</p>
<p>This is a great workout that can be progressed starting with 10x2min, with 10x3m the following week and up to 10x5m. Rest should increase between repetitions as they get longer.</p>

<h2>Bonus Marks</h2>
<p>Practice taking a gel or your favourite race nutrition during these workouts to train your gut to take in fuel during hard efforts. Use these sessions to get a better feel for your pacing at various intensities and race demands. Try at least once to perform these sessions without looking at your watch and instead tuning into your body to &#8220;feel&#8221; the pace and effort.</p>
<p>Knowing by feel how hard and for how long you can push a certain pace during your race is one of the most valuable racing skills you can develop.</p>
<p>All of these workouts are appropriate for any distance as long as you have enough training weeks in advance of your race to mix up the speed sessions. If you don&#8217;t have time to try them all, focus on the ones that support your specific race distance. Most of all, have fun!</p>

<div></div>
<div>Brought to you by the very man who discovered a young Mislawchuk as a hockey player looking for cross-training options, race director Dave Lipchen is at the helm of the Riding Mountain Triathlon in Manitoba, which celebrates its 4oth anniversary this year. The race returns to a full triathlon course after it was forced to run as a duathlon last year when the invasive species zebra mussels shut down the swim venue.</div>

<h2>Parks Canada opens lake to watercraft</h2>
<div>Parks Canada recently announced that it would allow watercraft on Clear Lake (also known as Wasagaming), the site of the race in the Riding Mountain National Park. The decision comes after a successful campaign last summer to curb the spread of zebra muscles in the lake. Parks Canada last year banned all watercraft, making it impossible for the race organization to provide safety crews on the lake for the swim portion of the race. As a result, Lipchen was forced to run the popular race as a duathlon.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Not long before, Lipchen was forced to confront the challenges presented by Covid-19. The long road back to a full triathlon has been challenging, he told The Brandon Sun newspaper.</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Rough ride the past few years</h2>
<div>&#8220;It was very tough to try to survive it. I&#8217;m not going to lie on that one,&#8221; Lipchen admitted. &#8220;It makes me question what&#8217;s the point of doing anything if everything gets completely wiped out every single time something is up.&#8221;</div>
<div>
<figure id=""attachment_23350"" aria-describedby=""caption-attachment-23350"" style=""width: 900px"" class=""wp-caption alignnone""><a href=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/131097.jpg""><img decoding=""async"" class=""size-full wp-image-23350"" src=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/131097.jpg"" alt="""" width=""900"" height=""600"" srcset=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/131097.jpg 900w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/131097-300x200.jpg 300w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/131097-768x512.jpg 768w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/131097-160x107.jpg 160w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/131097-320x213.jpg 320w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/131097-480x320.jpg 480w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/131097-640x427.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"" /></a><figcaption id=""caption-attachment-23350"" class=""wp-caption-text"">Riding Mountain Triathlon, Clear Lake, Manitoba</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But like the sport of triathlon, the road to the finish line comes with its ups and downs. Lipchen&#8217;s persistence has ultimately preserved a race that is important to the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, which don&#8217;t have as many race options as some of its neighbouring provinces.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Parks Canada announced a new program last month in its efforts to combat the spread of the invasive species, permitting a return to boats on the lake once again. As opposed to its previous zero tolerance approach of fully restricting watercraft, its new program aims to reduce the spread and continue to allow use of the lake by watercraft users.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lipchen is pleased that the program change opened the door again for his event, but sees the decision as a double edge sword.</div>

<div></div>
<div>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tough one. Obviously zebra mussels will explode and we will have to deal with that, but on the other hand, it&#8217;s like the ultimate invasive species, and everywhere already anyway.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Lipchen has faith that as one of Manitoba&#8217;s long running triathlons it will continue to weather the ups and downs for years to come.</div>
<h2>Race&#8217;s long history will endure</h2>
<div>&#8220;This one is engrained,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the earliest races in Triathlon Manitoba&#8217;s history. Once again though, a race is just one piece of the puzzle. The community is awesome. The national park is awesome. It&#8217;s beautiful. It has challenging everything. It has nice rolling hills. The water is beautiful. There is a very big business support community there with all the hotels and all the restaurants and shops.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>This year&#8217;s race includes a super sprint, sprint, Olympic, duathlon, aquabike and a Kids Of Steel race held on the weekend of August 16.</div>

Supertri E opened up its registration to a limited number of clubs in its local area of London, England. The amateur athletes will compete before the elites in the same fast-paced indoor event at the London Aquatics Centre on April 5.</p>
<h2 class=""p1"">Future races could include all age groupers</h2>
<p class=""p1"">The move signals Supertri’s continued expansion in the age group market. In its announcement, the company hints at the possibility that the indoor race could expand in scope to include beyond a few select clubs to the larger global age group audience.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“While the amateur racing in London is designed to offer a unique opportunity to experience the thrill of Supertri E, it opens up the tantalising prospect of greater participation opportunities, both real life and virtual, in the future,” the company stated.</p>

<h2 class=""p1"">Mixing it up with a new format</h2>
<p class=""p1"">It is the sixth season for the unique rapid-fire race that involves a pool swim, stationary bike and treadmill run. This year will see the fusing of real life and virtual racing with the addition of MyWhoosh virtual cycling app adding advanced technology. With MyWhoosh the race is a hybrid between live action and a virtual platform. Athletes will each have their own avatar and can see the power they generate on the bikes and speed on the run in a virtual world.</p>
<p>With a screen in front of them on the bike and run, athletes can monitor their competition as avatars and see everyone&#8217;s data. Spectators of the pro event can see both the real life action from within the arena and also through the virtual world on display.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The race format is changing too. In keeping with the original tradition of Supertri, athletes will repeat the swim, bike, run course multiple times by completing three rounds of each back-to-back during the finals round. The morning heats will involve only two rounds of each, determining the top 10 athletes who will advance to the final championship round later that day.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Our vision has always been to push the limits of triathlon, break down barriers to entry and create a community of triathlon fans,” said Supertri CEO Michael D’Hulst. “By opening Supertri E to the public, we’re giving athletes of all levels a unique opportunity to compete in a cutting-edge format and be part fo the action like never before.”</p>

<h2 class=""p1"">Big names and past champions on the start line</h2>
<p class=""p1"">Supertri E has evolved over the years to partner with MyWhoosh and World Triathlon. Last year it was held in the same venue and attracted record-breaking views. This year’s competition includes Paris Olympics gold medallist Cassandre Beaugrand from France, adding to the intensity for spectators and athletes alike. Beaugrand was the runner up to winner Beth Potter from Britain last year, but took the title in 2022. Potter holds the title for 2024 and 2023 with back-to-back wins.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Last year’s champions Chase McQueen from the US and Potter are confirmed to defend their titles. McQueen had to fend off Britain’s Max Stapley and France’s Maxime Hueber-Moosbrugger for the win in 2024.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Britain’s Jonny Brownlee is also on the start list, sure to entice his local fans to the arena and online to watch the excitement unfold.</p>

One more reason to buy new shoes. You're welcome. The post The wrong running shoe may be why you can’t shake that nagging injury appeared first on Triathlon Magazine Canada .,https://triathlonmagazine.ca/rss,"<p>A study examining running injuries is highlighting the double-edge sword of being consistent in training.</p>
<p>While consistency is often referenced as the one training element that trumps all others in terms of improved performance, in the context of running mechanics it can also increase your risk of injury.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the frequency of your runs that is the underlying issue. Consistently executing programmed runs for the week is still a winning strategy. The problem around consistency arises when you are repeatedly running with bad form. Making the same gait error repeatably will lead you down the wrong path. Wearing the wrong shoes on top of that may get you there even quicker.</p>
<p>The study, published in the <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2024.1491486/full""><em>Frontiers in Sports and Active Living </em></a>journal analyzed the foot strike pattern of 710 runners across different backgrounds. The group was first divided based on being a self-reported heel striker, mid or forefoot striker, or not knowing how their feet were hitting the ground.</p>
<p><a href=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1010607080.jpg""><img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-67750"" src=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1010607080.jpg"" alt=""shoes https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2024.1491486/full"" width=""724"" height=""483"" srcset=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1010607080.jpg 724w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1010607080-300x200.jpg 300w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1010607080-160x107.jpg 160w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1010607080-320x213.jpg 320w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1010607080-480x320.jpg 480w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1010607080-640x427.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"" /></a></p>
<h2>Why heel-to-toe drop matters</h2>
<p>Researchers reviewed each runner&#8217;s gait using slow-motion technology. Alongside the gait analysis data they reviewed injury history. The study revealed that runners who reported they didn&#8217;t know what their foot strike pattern was were more likely to develop a running injury.</p>
<p>The significance of not knowing one&#8217;s striking pattern leads to improper decisions around heel-to-toe drop considerations when choosing a shoe. The higher the drop and heavier the shoe the less body awareness one experiences while running. This lack of awareness is affectively hiding poor form and leading to the constant repetition of a poor gait causing injury.</p>
<p>Changing shoe styles was also associated with increased injury risk. If a runner is switching up the heel-to-toe drop they could be moving from a good situation to a bad one, or vice versa. Getting in the right shoe and staying in it is another kind of consistency that pays off here.</p>
<p>Generally, less drop and a lighter shoe will allow one to feel the ground better, creating more body awareness. This allows the runner to feel the landing, loading and toe off better with minimal drop and a lighter shoe. A more dramatic drop and a heavy foot shifts the body&#8217;s weight and dulls the senses.</p>

<h2>Know before you go is the best way forward</h2>
<p>A low or no drop shoe may not be the answer either. The essence of the data ties back into the idea of knowing what your foot strike pattern is and buying a shoe a drop and weight that is optimal for the individual. How the heel-to-toe drop shifts weight forward should be a consideration when trying out different brands. A more even distribution of weight from a less dramatic drop can reduce load on specific joints.</p>
<p>A mild drop shoe is considered to be in the range of 4-6mm. It may be worth trying a shoe in this range and avoiding models that are clunky or heavy and interfere with the foot&#8217;s natural feel for the ground. Any change in shoe should be introduced gradually to allow the body to slowly and safely adapt.</p>

Even at a sprint event the swim isn’t going to go down at a sprint pace. There are still many benefits to improving your short distance speed even when your race distance is much longer.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Increasing your swim speed will contribute to your overall swim fitness. Your top speed is your ceiling and your race pace is a percentage of that top speed. Raising your ceiling means raising your race pace. In fact, it will raise your all your paces, including your slow pace.</p>
<h2>Benefits of a sprinting in long distance</h2>
<p class=""p3"">Being able to access your sprint speed during a race goes beyond your swim time. It is a useful skill to have in order to execute a smart and tactical race. You will need to tap into your speed skills to surge ahead of a group of slow or weaving swimmers in open water, or trying to catch up to someone’s feet to draft.</p>

<p class=""p3"">Speed also comes in handy at the start of the race when you are strategically vying for a place amongst a group swimming at your pace, or diverting from a full contact situation. The key to improving top speed is to swim at max effort and take quality rest in between intervals so you are fresh for each repetition. Short changing on the rest diminishes the quality of each interval and prevents you from swimming as hard as possible on each one.</p>
<h2>Where does speed work fit in?</h2>
<p class=""p3"">There will be a time and place for threshold work on shorter rest, and long endurance sets on even less rest. But neglecting speed work minimizes your gains in these other important areas too. Raising the ceiling of your VO2max during sprint work makes all your zone paces faster.</p>

<p class=""p3"">Sprint work can be the main focus of a pool session or incorporated into a longer workout. Always tackle the sprint sets after a good warm up but before the longer endurance or threshold sets which will zap your energy for the shorter, more intense speed work.</p>

<h2>Keep a smooth not frantic technique</h2>
<p>When the workout calls for an all out effort it&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of flailing arms and legs as fast as possible. A smooth stroke is more efficient and faster than a frantic stroke. Expending more energy doesn&#8217;t equate to faster times in the pool. The highly technical nature of swimming rewards a smooth stroke over brute force.</p>
<p>Think &#8220;smooth&#8221; not &#8220;fast&#8221; when speeding up. Of course the goal is to move your arms and legs faster, but not so fast that your form falls apart and all you end up doing is increasing output not speed. It is better to give up a bit of speed to maintain form while still sprinting. By working on speed while still maintaining proper form you will spend less energy going faster.</p>
<p>Speed work should be an important and regular part of your training plan. While it&#8217;s tempting to stick to the slower, more endurance-based sets, don&#8217;t pass up the opportunity to elevate your swim skills and set a PB at your next race.</p>

Ruffle, who works for RBC as a Manager, Credit Structures, Private Banking, RBC Wealth Management, has been riding the Enbridge Tour Alberta for Cancer since 2018. If you asked him the year before if he could manage a weekend that would total 200 km, he wouldn’t believe you.</p>
<p>“I was riding my mountain bike a lot when someone asked me to do the event, a colleague. When I heard 100 km a day for two days, I thought, ‘no way,’” he says. “But I went to the bike store, got some road pedals, and dove in.”</p>
<h2>Choices for all levels</h2>
<p>Still, the event is for all levels of riding, and you have plenty of choice. For 2025, there are a few additions to the event. There’s a challenge route has been upgraded from 140km to 160km, for those who want an even tougher day on the saddle.</p>
<p>This new route offers a Saturday only option with a longer distance for riders looking to push their limits. Participants still have the choice of the regular routes, with a Short (~65 km) and Long (~100 km) option available for all levels of riders. There are pit stops every 25 km providing hydration, nutrition, rest areas, and bike maintenance, with sweep vehicle crews along the route. The post-ride festival features hydration, nutrition, participant support (massage, yoga, cool-down areas, showers, camping, beverage gardens).</p>
<p>Ruffle has come a long way since his first Tour. He’s one of the co-captains of Team RBC, and since 2012, Team RBC has participated with teams ranging anywhere from 22 to 44 riders. 2024 was one of the strongest years for registered riders and fundraising, with over $200,000 raised for the 2024 ride, bringing Team RBC’s overall total fundraising to over $1.2 million.</p>
<p>“Cycling means the world to me now, but knowing that I can use my bike to help fight cancer is even more important,” he says.</p>

<h2>The personal importance of the ride</h2>
<p>Like so many Canadians, Ruffle has lost someone to cancer. Nancy Barnes, the late wife of Ruffle’s coworker Russell, rode the Tour with Team RBC, along with her three sons. She rode it six times, despite being afflicted with the disease.</p>
<p>She died in March of 2022, and her family, including her husband Russell, and Ruffle, continue to ride in her memory.</p>
<p>“I met Nancy after initially meeting Russell, and both individuals were such strong supporters of both the ride and all riders in the event,” Ruffle says. “A quote from a LinkedIn post that Nancy always went by sticks with me: ‘Cancer is not who I am, but rather a condition I live with’ – Nancy. And that was so true. Despite her condition, her fight, and her determination, she was out there to support us and even ride. Nancy was a true champion—a champion of determination right until the end.”</p>

<p>Although he does have a full-time job, Ruffle manages to get in 200 km a week in training. He rides both the road and gravel to keep his fitness. In the summer, he tends to crank out more miles, but in the fall, he’s a fan of getting out there on his gravel bike. The gravel bike requires a bit more clothing in the autumn weather, but it means more miles outdoors—something he loves, especially living in beautiful Alberta.</p>
<h2>2025: Bigger and better than ever</h2>
<p>The 2025 edition comes after 2024, where the Enbridge Tour Alberta for Cancer reached the incredible $100,000,000 fundraising milestone. The Tour is a unified effort for more—world-class cancer research, advanced equipment, dedicated teams, hope, and cherished moments. Funds are raised for the Alberta Cancer Foundation, with the Enbridge Tour Alberta for Cancer being its signature event.</p>

<p>The Alberta Cancer Foundation acts as a beacon of hope by empowering and uniting Albertans around a common purpose, investing in the future of cancer research and care, and ensuring no Albertan facing cancer walks alone. The tagline of the Tour, “Pedal for More Hope,” is just that. Riders are riding the Tour to push for more hope for those with Cancer, and those around them.</p>
<p>For Ruffle, personally, this year is just as important, if not more important, than the first year he took part.</p>
<p>“I am looking forward to the 2025 ride for the same reasons that keep me coming back year after year: Cancer does not yet have a cure, cancer impacts too many people, and cancer takes too many lives regardless of age. We are all impacted by cancer, whether it is personally or knowing someone. We know the impact it has financially, emotionally, physically—and regardless of age, it sucks,” he says.<br />
He knows that he and the thousands of others who ride, who donate, and who create awareness are making a difference.</p>
<p>“The more we ride, the more we fundraise, the better care and research we can provide, and get the cure we need,” Ruffle says.</p>

<p>It is the first time the drafting detection system was used by amateur athletes. The device is designed to enhance fair play by signalling to the rider when they are in the draft zone using a lighting system. The company&#8217;s goal is to expand the use of the device across the whole field using the intel it collected at Challenge Wanaka and previous data from pro racers.</p>

<h2>RaceRanger provided clarity about drafting zones</h2>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really pleased with how the trial went,&#8221; said RaceRanger co-founder and CEO James Elvery post-race. &#8220;The feedback from athletes has been overwhelmingly positive. Many appreciated the clarity RaceRanger provided, eliminating any guesswork around drafting distances and making the racing experience fairer.</p>
<p>For the company, its goal was to learn more about the hands-on experience of distributing, installing and monitoring the devices in the age group field. The application to the larger competition field varies from its tried and true methods at the pro level, with additional complications scaling up.</p>

<h2>Adaptations needed to install on all bikes</h2>
<p>Physically installing the devices on a wide variety of bikes was one challenge the company was hoping to learn from to create a more seamless process in the future. Fitting the tech on a bike requires space on the seat post and not every bike was set up ideally to make this possible. The test versions were set to turn on automatically before the race start, a deviation from operating with a smaller pro field.</p>
<p>Elvery shared that athletes were pleased to know the precise distance and the opportunity to race honestly. Many age group athletes have been vocal over the years about their frustrations on the bike course witnessing brazen displays of drafting and even large groups of riders hanging together like a group ride.</p>

<h2>Lighting system easy to use</h2>
<p>He added that he was pleased to see that the testers were actively engaging the light system as intended. Elvery came away from the day believing that there is a real interest from age groupers to use the device and tamp out drafting. Many athletes reported they appreciated knowing for certain that their distance was draft legal during the race.</p>
<p>Four drafting penalties were handed out during the race and many more warnings, but it wasn&#8217;t clear at the time if they were a direct result of RaceRanger.</p>
<p>The next step is to scale the application to thousands of athletes. The company is working towards refining the technology to make it even easier for the individual to use. Testing at Challenge Wanaka involved technicians fitting individual bikes with two devices and connecting those to the internet. This allowed the technology to provide live tracking and real-time data for athletes as well as spectators, technical officials and race organizers.</p>

<h2>Scaling for mass participation</h2>
<p>Elvery said Challenge Wanaka was chosen as a testing ground because of its ideal size. The company&#8217;s challenge is now to streamline distribution in a way that would deliver the device to all athletes through something as simple as picking it up like one would a timing chip.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s focus is on improving device activation, management and post-race retrieval before it can take it mainstream. The ultimate goal is to reach mass participation with age group athletes.</p>
<h2>More engineering and expansion</h2>
<p>It has already been in use for a while at the pro level. The system was a mainstay with pro athletes on the PTO T100 World Tour last year. It has also been put to use at the Ironman World Championships and Challenge Roth.</p>
<p>The pro field is a much smaller scale than the age group category. Elvery said expanding to the larger age group market requires more engineering and ensuring continuous connectivity as the company continues to trial and evolve the system.</p>

<p>The Institute of Sport&#8217;s National Research Institute study was published in Biology of Sport last month. It concludes that cyclists do not need to incorporate any resistance training outside of sessions on the bike to &#8220;increase strength, muscle-tendon structure, and pedaling performance,&#8221; beyond what a cyclist can achieve on-bike.</p>
<p>The study investigated the outcome of high-intensity resistance workouts comparing their effectiveness when done on the bike and off the bike.</p>

<h2>How the study was conducted</h2>
<p>Put to the test were a total of 37 cyclists who followed a resistance program for 10 weeks. One group performed the workouts in the gym doing squats while the second group performed all-out pedalling efforts on the bike. Intensity, volume, sets and rest were identical for both groups.</p>
<p>A third group that didn&#8217;t follow any resistance program for the 10 week period was used as a control group. This final group continued their regular training routine with no additional resistance training.</p>
<p>The study revealed &#8220;no significant differences were found between off- and on-bike RT (resistance training) in any parameter.&#8221; Both off-and on-bike groups improved maximal aerobic power at ventilation threshold and off-bike maximal dynamic force (MDF).</p>
<h2>Differences found were negligible</h2>
<p>Only slight differentiations were recorded. The group focusing solely on resistance training on the bike significantly increased pedalling MDF. Quadricep size of the group focused on training in the gym was &#8220;significantly&#8221; increased, while the on-bike group experienced an &#8220;enhancement&#8221; of quadricep size and patellar tendon size.</p>
<p>Both resistance training groups saw improvements in time-to-exhaustion capacity, though not significantly. The off-bike group saw an increase in injury-related symptoms.</p>
<p>The control group did not see gains in MDF or quadricep size. The study&#8217;s research concluded that the &#8220;findings suggest that high-intensity on-bike RT is an effective alternative to off-bike RT to safely increase strength, muscle-tendon structure, and cycling performance.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Control group did not improve strength</h2>
<p>The control group, which did not focus on resistance training, did not see any significant gains in pedalling MDF, quadricep size, strength, muscle-tendon structure or injury-related sysmptoms, such that the two other groups did.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there was no strong evidence that low-cadence &#8220;torque&#8221; training that this type of training on-bike effectively improves neuromuscular and cycling performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The relative force achieved during traditional torque training is overall low (&lt;50% of cyclists&#8217; maximal pedaling force), which in turn might explain why the desired neuromuscular adaptations might not be attained using this method,&#8221; it stated.</p>
<p>The study&#8217;s research was based on 100 per cent compliance of all participants, and there were no dropout.</p>

Lionel Sanders takes radical new approach to training this year,https://triathlonmagazine.ca/personalities/pro/lionel-sanders-takes-radical-new-approach-to-training-this-year/,Charlotte Petrie,"Tue, 18 Feb 2025 20:44:43 +0000","['News', 'Pro', 'Lionel Sanders', 'news', 'no limits', 'pro triathlon training', 'triathlon training']","{'@isPermaLink': 'false', '#text': 'https://triathlonmagazine.ca/?p=81771'}",Will less be more for Sanders' season? The post Lionel Sanders takes radical new approach to training this year appeared first on Triathlon Magazine Canada .,https://triathlonmagazine.ca/rss,"<p>With a name in triathlon synonymous with pushing to extremes with a &#8220;No Limits&#8221; mentality, one the sports most popular pros is taking a &#8220;smart not hard&#8221; approach to training this season.</p>
<p>Lionel Sanders recently shared on his YouTube channel that he is looking to do more than smashing himself in workouts. Highlighting past mistakes, he points to overdoing it on the bike in his effort to emulate cycling pros, recognizing that the demands of pro cycling are not the same as triathlon. He goes so far as to point out how illogical his past approach has been in using such high volume training when a better balance is required to be successful at his chosen sport.</p>
<h2>Specificity over volume</h2>
<p>He is tossing volume aside to focus on specificity. This will be the year he will take time to understand the specific demands of triathlon and chase workouts that support those demands over getting in as much volume as possible. By being purposeful with every session, he expects to train smarter not harder. When he lines up at his next race he hopes to not only be fit for competition, but also rested enough to express that fitness.</p>
<p>The high-volume training approach is also a trap that many pros fell into following in the footsteps of the Norwegians and the insanely high-volume nature of their revered methodology. Even the Norwegians have since made a shift as their head coach, Alexander Bu, moved on to focus on pro cycling, and after two seasons that saw lackluster results.</p>

<h2>Optimizing sessions to meet race demands</h2>
<p>This lighter training load with sport specific training will deliver Sanders to the start line fresh and ready for a peak performance, he explained. While he had a successful 2024 season winning Ironman 70.3 Oceanside, 70.3 Mont Tremblant, and Ironman Canada, he had another disappointing performance at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii. He is openly critical on YouTube about his direction last year and the illogical nature of getting in as much volume as possible with little regard for training specificity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I ride my bike for only two hours and expect to do four hours at bottom of zone three, upper zone two and then also run well after in zone three?&#8221; he questioned. &#8220;The answer to that is no. Why in the world would you be able to do that suddenly on any particular race day &#8211; that&#8217;s illogical,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Sanders&#8217; new approach is a long-held, tried and true method for many pro athletes. Recently, this methodology hasn&#8217;t had as much showtime as the more mysterious or more hardcore high-volume approaches that the Norwegians and he have taken, respectably. It&#8217;s a shift for Sanders, but a move that brings him into a well-established realm of training that&#8217;s proven itself time and again.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a volume standpoint I believe in specificity of volume, so as long as I am doing the specific sessions with which to meet the demands of the race, then whatever the volume of that ends up being is what the volume ends up being.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Still chasing his best performance yet</h2>
<p>Sanders is clear about one thing. He is confident that his best performance is yet to come. In accepting that his previous thinking has been &#8220;stupid&#8221; and &#8220;insecure&#8221; he is vowing to spend more time recovering and tapering ahead of races.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only have one goal for myself now, and it is I want to achieve my best, and I know how to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Expect another year of exciting and eventful action from Sanders as he chases down his competition in the Ironman Pro Series this season.</p>

Continuing to test its T100 stars in environments that offer different terrains and conditions, the professional course will start with a 2km sea swim in Mediterranean waters off Figueretas Beach, with 2 laps […] The post New Pro & Amateur Courses Revealed for Ibiza T100 Triathlon appeared first on PTO .",https://protriathletes.org/news/rss,"<p><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ibiza, Spain: </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Professional Triathletes Organisation (PTO) has revealed new professional and amateur courses for its </span><b><i>Ibiza T100 Triathlon </i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">on 28-29 September.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Continuing to test its </span><b><i>T100</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> stars in environments that offer different terrains and conditions, the professional course will start with a 2km sea swim in Mediterranean waters off Figueretas Beach, with 2 laps around off-shore buoys before heading back to the beach and T1.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The 80km pro bike course will be made up of 3 laps: two of 31km &#8211; including a 3.1km link from T1 &#8211; that takes the athletes across to Santa Eulalia City and back, before a final lap of 14.9km. There will be a testing mix of climbs, technical sections and head-down TT sections, before a fast and flat run with 7 laps of a 2.57km course around the historic Ibiza Old Town. Weaving into the World Heritage area of the city before finishing on the Port front. To see the pro course, visit the </span><b><i>T100</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> website </span><a href=""https://t100triathlon.com/ibiza/pro/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Age Groupers taking on the 100km challenge will face a similar challenge, starting with a 2km loop around the island “Illa de Ses Rates”. The bike course takes a slightly different route across the island compared to the professionals, consisting of 3 laps of 25km with a 2.3km link from T1 and back to T2, before concluding the race on a similar run course. See it </span><a href=""https://t100triathlon.com/ibiza/participate/100km-open/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As well as the professional and amateur 100km triathlon, the PTO has also introduced a range of open water sea swims &#8211; in keeping with its desire to encourage and cater for participants of all abilities and make the most of the idyllic surroundings. More details of further amateaur races will be released soon.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“We are excited to announce these courses,” said Sam Renouf, CEO of the PTO, who have continued to work closely with both the Spanish Triathlon Federation (FETRI) and Ibiza to build on last year’s successful event. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“We had stellar start lists in Ibiza last year with three Olympic champions &#8211; Jan Frodeno (2008), Alistair Brownlee (2012 &amp; 2016) and Kristian Blummenfelt (2020) &#8211; taking part in the men’s race, and then all of the world’s top 10 PTO-ranked female athletes. But we expect the athlete start lists this year to be even stronger, due to the contracted </span><b><i>T100</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> athletes who will need to join the start line in this fifth race of the new </span><b><i>T100 </i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">series. For example, the appearance of Spanish superstar Javier Gómez Noya will be very much anticipated by a fervent home crowd.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Responding on behalf of FETRI, its president </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">José </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hidalgo said: “In the Spanish Triathlon Federation we are very pleased to continue our partnership with the PTO and hold their new </span><b><i>T100</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> races in Ibiza and also include our Middle Distance Spanish Cup at the 100km distance.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The amateur 100km race over the weekend will include two fields. An Open event that anyone can race in, and then the Middle Distance Spanish Cup for Elite and Age Group categories, which includes a prize fund of more than €15,000 for the top individual finishers as well as for the best represented clubs.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are limited places left for all the amateur events due to high demand</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, so you’re encouraged to register as soon as possible.</span></p>

The post Ashleigh Gentle Wins PTO US Open In Texas Heat appeared first on PTO .,https://protriathletes.org/news/rss,"<p>PTO World #6 Ashleigh Gentle put in an astonishing run performance despite soaring temperatures to claim the first-ever PTO US Open title.</p>



<p>The Australian star, who is now three-from-three at PTO Tour events this year – and $245,000 richer because of it – overtook home-country hope Taylor Knibb in the closing stages to secure another incredible victory. In doing so, Gentle has confirmed her status as the world&#8217;s preeminent 100km racer.</p>



<p>You can <a href=""https://plus.protriathletes.org/video/394736/pto-us-open--womens-race-replay"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">watch the full replay of the women&#8217;s race now on PTO+</a> in all territories outside Europe and the Indian Subcontinent, where it will be available 48-hours after the race ended.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">PTO US Open – How It Played Out</h2>



<p>As predicted, Lucy Charles-Barclay was soon at the front in the water, Taylor Knibb the only athlete to stick on her feet. With the rest of the field strung out behind them, the Brit and American came out of the water for the mid-way Australian exit with a lead of 31 seconds to a group including Holly Lawrence, Ashleigh Gentle, Flora Duffy, Paula Findlay and Lisa Norden.</p>



<p>By the end of the swim, that lead had only increased, with Charles-Barclay and Knibb leaving the water in 27:01 (1:21/100m) one minute ahead of the chasers. Charles-Barclay stole a march of around 15 seconds on Knibb through T1 while the chase pack was led onto the seven-lap bike course by Holly Lawrence, 1:05 after Knibb.</p>



<p>At around 8km into the 80km course, Knibb surged past Charles-Barclay and began to put time into everyone on the course. During lap two, Charles-Barclay, who had already lost her race nutrition bottle from the rear of her bike, had a brief stop to address an issue with her electronic shifting, which had apparently overheated under the Texan sun.</p>



<p>By halfway through the bike, Knibb’s buffer was 1:51 to Charles-Barclay. In turn, the Brit had a 1:12 gap to the four chasers who’d detached themselves from the rest: Holly Lawrence, Paula Findlay, Flora Duffy and Lisa Norden, some 3:03 off the leader.</p>



<p>By the start of the final lap, Knibb’s lead was up to 3:04, Charles-Barclay holding steady at 2:08 ahead of the chase pack and losing a more time – now 5:13 behind Knibb. Meanwhile PTO Canadian Open winner Ashleigh Gentle was leading the second chase group, 6:19 from the front and 1:06 from the podium contenders ahead.</p>



<p>Showing no sign of weakness, Knibb pushed on to T2 and after a controlled transition, started the 18km, five-lap run with a lead of 3:42 to Lucy Charles-Barclay. 2:25 later (6:07 behind Knibb), Findlay, Duffy, Lawrence and Norden began the run shoulder to shoulder. However, it wasn’t long before Duffy, the double Commonwealth Champion upped the pace to take a clear third place on the course.</p>



<p>Ashleigh Gentle, eighth off the bike and 6:52 off the lead, stormed onto the final leg, quickly establishing herself as the fastest runner on the course. Soon, Duffy faltered while the Australian seemed unphased by the heat overtaking within the first 5km.</p>



<p>From there, Gentle continued to hunt her prey, overcoming her deficit to Lucy Charles-Barclay by 10km. Initially, it seemed the Aussie would run out of road to catch Knibb, but the American was reduced to a walk over a couple of short sections as the conditions took their toll.</p>



<p>Making the pass just before the 16km mark, Gentle had 2km of running to soak up the fact she would be taking a second consecutive PTO Open victory worth another $100,000. She crossed the line in 3:37:17 after a 1:04:59 run, which was four minutes faster than any other woman.</p>



<p>Knibb held on for second and $70,000 with a 3:38:32 finish while Lucy Charles-Barclay completed the podium in 3:40:31 to earn $50,000.</p>



<p>Holly Lawrence paced herself perfectly to stay in the hunt for big money, coming fourth in 3:43:37 to claim $40,000. Lisa Norden’s 3:44:49 finish was worth $35,000, the Swede pipping Olympic Champion Flora Duffy to round out the top five.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Podium Quotes</h2>



<p>“I’m getting all emotional now,” said a jubilant Ashleigh Gentle. “It’s been a really good year &#8211; it’s been a lot of fun. I’ve definitely been enjoying the sport again. Thanks to the PTO for putting this on and giving us triathletes the opportunity to race these world-class events against world-class athletes. It’s a privilege to be here and I am just absolutely in shock.” </p>



<p>On the race in the Texan heat, the PTO World #6 said: “I had to dig to the depths of myself for that one &#8211; that was really, really tough.  Seeing the group ride away was a little depressing but I just tried to keep my head in the game and hope that I could run into a good position. I absolutely did not expect to have run into the win.</p>



<p>“I’ve been telling myself the last couple of days that it is not that hot but it is very hot and I just tried to manage my pacing well. I guess it paid off.”</p>



<p>Second-place finisher, Taylor Knibb, the PTO World #7, was in pole position for much of the race and takes home $70,000. The 24-year-old American said: “I&#8217;m just so grateful to go to get to the finish line. I don&#8217;t know how I made it… I was just dying, overheating. I couldn&#8217;t move any faster. Like that was. I don&#8217;t know how I made the finish line. And that&#8217;s pretty much all I can say.”</p>



<p>The third-place getter, Lucy Charles-Barclay, was first out the water, hung tough on the bike, and ran strongly to take the final podium position and $50,000. The British star and PTO World #5 said: “That was absolutely brutal out there. And to anyone who is finishing this in these conditions, these ladies are just hard as nails. That was incredibly tough conditions to overcome. And yeah, I&#8217;m just happy to make the finish line, to be fair.</p>



<p>“I had my fair share of nightmares out there. Unfortunately, I was stuck in the hardest gear for the first two laps. I think the battery must have died or overheated and the mechanic gave me a new battery. Once we got that sorted, I felt up and running, but I had lost my nutrition… this is not the environment where you want to lose your nutrition. So I just had to keep my head, try and get as much nutrition on board and tough it out on that bike psychologically.<br><br>“I had to dig deep and find something. I mean, I&#8217;ve trained incredibly hard. So, you know, this is the moment that you&#8217;ve been working for. And when things don&#8217;t go quite right, you&#8217;ve just got to tough it out. And I think I&#8217;ve gained a lot just from overcoming those things going into my next races.”</p>

<p>In the Collins Cup battle between Team Europe, Team US and Team International, it was the defending champions from Europe who prevailed on home soil. Winning eight of the 12 match-ups, Team Europe proved the continue to rule the sport of triathlon while a strong Team International passed the ignominious Broken Spokes trophy to Team US.</p>



<p>Team Europe got off to a stellar start with PTO World #1 Daniela Ryf, who, after racing while suffering shingles last, had the performance she was truly capable of to seal the fastest women’s time of the day, beating Olympic Champion Flora Duffy in the process.</p>



<p>Another key match-up was Kristian Blummenfelt’s domination – the <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/rankings/men"">PTO World #1</a> and Olympic, World Triathlon and Ironman World Champion adding the fastest time at the Collins Cup to his resume.</p>



<p>Much of the talk in the build-up to the 2022 edition of the Collins Cup race centred on the exchanges between Team Europe’s Sam Laidlow and Team US’s Sam Long – who had agreed to disagree as pre-match exchanges <a href=""https://twitter.com/protriorg/status/1560941328191594498?s=20&amp;t=qBQ62namFxGKD5J2mA5HzA"">reached boiling point</a> following the event&#8217;s Opening Ceremony.</p>



<p>That match provided compelling viewing as Sanders and Long wiped out a huge swim deficit to Laidlow on the bike before sealing the European&#8217;s fate on the run. From there, it was an epic shoulder-to-shoulder battle that could only be decided by an all-out sprint to the finish in which Sanders clinched victory for Team International.</p>



<p>The final scores were 53 for Team Europe, 38 for Team International and 22.5 for Team US. Team Europe took eight of 12 match wins with Team International coming first in the other four, meaning Team US failed to win a single match.</p>



<p>The 12 match-ups went head-to-head-to-head over 100km – a 2km swim, 80km bike and 18km run. Here is a rundown of how it played out in Samorin along with key quotes from the finish line.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 1</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Daniela Ryf (EUR) vs Sarah True (US) vs Flora Duffy (INT)</strong></p>



<p>After initially holding onto Flora Duffy’s feet, Daniela Ryf and Sarah True were left to swim together as Duffy motored away. That equalled a 25-second lead to Ryf and True out the water, a lead that extended to over 30 seconds thanks to Duffy’s swift transition.</p>



<p>Soon Ryf had Duffy in her sights while True couldn’t hold with the pace of the Team Europe athlete. By halfway through the bike leg, in classic Ryf style, the Swiss Miss was 1:39 ahead of the Olympic Champion with Sarah True almost three minutes behind. Ryf’s charge continued unchallenged, the <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/rankings/women"">PTO World #1</a> creating a seemingly insurmountable buffer of 5:37 to Duffy and 6:48 to True.</p>



<p>While Duffy did bite some time from her deficit at first, Ryf remained incredibly strong to win in 3:28:50, some 6:58 ahead of Duffy and 11:30 ahead of True to claim a full six points.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 1 / INT – 3</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Daniela Ryf</strong></p>



<p>“It feels really amazing to be coming back after last year I could perform well in all three and feel like I&#8217;m a complete athlete again. When I got to the last km I heard it was 5s over 5 min so I pushed as hard as I could to try to get the max 6 points.</p>



<p>“Last year I raced while I was sick. I had blisters all over my legs, I had shingles and you obviously can&#8217;t race like that. This morning I went for a jog and my heart rate was about 30 beats lower than last year.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 2</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Laura Philipp (EUR) vs Chelsea Sodaro (US) vs Ashleigh Gentle (INT)</strong></p>



<p>Mirroring Match 1, Ashleigh Gentle took the lead in the water with Chelsea Sodaro and Laura Philip tucked in closely behind. It wasn’t long before the Australian pulled ahead to create a margin of just over a minute after the 2km was done.</p>



<p>Philip had closed the gap to 40 seconds by 40km in, with Sodaro 3:12 behind. The German soon made the junction to Gentle and took the lead going on to press her advantage to 54 seconds by T2. Sodaro meanwhile was struggling at 10 minutes off the pace.</p>



<p>Gentle, winner of the recent PTO Canadian Open, quickly ran down the German and took back her lead. From there it was plain sailing for the Australian, going on to win in 3:30:51. Laura Philip managed to keep her deficit to 2:32 while Sodaro was over 15-minutes back.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 3.5 / US – 1 / INT – 5</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 3</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Kat Matthews (EUR) vs Sky Moench (US) vs Paula Findlay (INT)</strong></p>



<p>With Paula Findlay swimming to the front, Team International were once again leading in Match 3. The Canadian managed to eke out 21 seconds to Kat Matthews and a minute to Sky Moench. Findlay wasted no time on two wheels – piling on the pressure to create a gap to the chasers.</p>



<p>By halfway, Findlay had a lead of 2:03 to Matthews, who had Moench right behind her. That buffer continued to grow, Findlay running out of T2 with 4:22 in hand to Moench and 5:24 to Matthews, who appeared to be having less than her usual bike strength.</p>



<p>Findlay remained super strong throughout the 18km run to take the tape in 3:31:10, taking maximum points with a 6:46 lead to Matthews and 7:30 to Moench.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 2 / US – 1 / INT – 6</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 4</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Nicola Spirig (EUR) vs Sophie Watts (US) vs Vittoria Lopes (INT)</strong></p>



<p>With Lopes’ swimming pedigree, there was no doubt it would be pole position once again for Team International in the swim. The Brazilian came into T1 with a 25-second lead to double-Olympic medallist Nicola Spirig with Sophie Watts over two minutes behind.</p>



<p>In her last international triathlon competition, Nicola Spirig showed she wasn’t here to make up the numbers by charging to the front of her match and taking a lead of 2:24 to Lopes by halfway and 4:03 to Watts.</p>



<p>The Swiss superstar reached T2 with a lead of 4:49 to Watts and didn’t let up for a moment, rounding off her international career with a sensational win some 16:32 ahead of Lopes. Meanwhile, Watts was forced to withdraw.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 1 / INT – 3.5</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Nicola Spirig</strong></p>



<p>“I was pretty nervous. I felt pretty good but didn’t know what to expect. I had the extra pressure from the team. I was nervous but came out of the water and was 25 seconds behind Lopes and knew I could make that.</p>



<p>“I was really keen to show I was the right pick and I deserved the spot and I’m really happy I’ve helped the team to have a good performance.</p>



<p>“I’m just happy to have a good performance in my last international race and it’s nice to go out like that.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 5</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Holly Lawrence (EUR) vs Jocelyn McCauley (US) vs Ellie Salthouse (INT)</strong></p>



<p>Team Europe were first out of the water in Match 5, Holly Lawrence leading but with Team International’s Ellie Salthouse just six seconds behind. Team US’s Jocelyn McCauley – the second-fastest biker here last year – was only 1:04 down. The American continued to make inroads and took the lead just after the halfway mark. Lawrence managed to stick closely to McCauley, the pair dropping Salthouse convincingly.</p>



<p>Once on the run, it was Lawrence’s day. The Brit ruled the run to cross the line in 3:33:10, 4:33 ahead of McCauley and a massive 13:18 ahead of Salthouse, who had a tough race but pushed on to the end.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 5.5 / US – 3.5 / INT – 1</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 6</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Anne Haug (EUR) vs Jackie Hering (US) vs Tamara Jewett (INT)</strong></p>



<p>In perhaps one of the most evenly-weighted match-ups, there was nothing to separate Anne Haug, Jackie Hering and Tamara Jewett out of the water. That status quo remained throughout the bike, all three women entering transition within 15 seconds of one another.</p>



<p>From there Haug steadily moved away over the 18km, proving herself the sport’s best runner once again to cross the line in 3:33:57, 1:44 ahead of Jewett and 5:23 ahead of Hering.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 4 / US – 1 / INT – 2.5</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Anne Haug</strong></p>



<p>“My main goal was to stick with the girls on the swim because I’m with them in T1 then everything is in my hands and it was. Jackie did a great job on the bike until the turning point and then I took control and then just wanted to run fast.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 7</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Kristian Blummenfelt (EUR) vs Ben Kanute (US) vs Hayden Wilde (INT)</strong></p>



<p>With an expectation that Team US’s Ben Kanute would lead from the water, it was a little surprising to see Hayden Wilde right behind him and Olympic Champion Kristian Blummenfelt just five seconds behind.</p>



<p>While Kanute initially pushed the pace on the bike, he was never out of sight of his competitors. Blummenfelt took the lead around 50km in and didn’t look back, reaching T2 with a 1:45 buffer to Kanute and 5:05 for Wilde. Keeping the pressure on during the run leg, Blummenfelt’s lead ballooned while Wilde tracked down Kanute to move into second at around 8km in.</p>



<p>The Olympic Champion, Ironman World Champion and World Triathlon Champion stormed to victory in 3:09:19 setting a benchmark for the other men to follow. Wilde was over eight minutes behind with Kanute nearly 12 minutes back.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 1 / INT – 2.5</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Kristian Blummenfelt</strong></p>



<p>“It’s tough to come from sprint distance to 100km but I knew that Hayden was one of the ones who could do it. That’s why I stayed behind until 50km or so on the bike because that’s when it starts to get hard and was super stoked with my run legs.</p>



<p>“The support out on the course was giving me a little bit more energy and it’s such a great place.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 8</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Sam Laidlow (EUR) vs Sam Long (US) vs Lionel Sanders (INT)</strong></p>



<p>In a match that had courted controversy before even a toe was dipped in the water. Team Europe’s Sam Laidlow went out fast to immediately distance Sam Long and Lionel Sanders, scything through the water to create a lead of 3:17 after the 2km swim.</p>



<p>By halfway into the 80km bike, Laidlow was 2:37 ahead of Sanders who was sitting just in front of Long, the pair switching turns through. By 53km, the Frenchman’s lead was down to just 1:33 and still narrowing. By T2, Sanders and Long had Laidlow in their sights and indeed pushed past him in the first kilometer. From there Long and Sanders were running shoulder to shoulder as Laidlow was eventually forced to walk, clutching his stomach.</p>



<p>Long surged around halfway through the run to create a gap, but the elastic never truly snapped with Sanders getting back up to the American. In the end, it was a sprint finish between the pair that decided the match, Sanders outpacing Long as they entered the stadium to clinch the match in 3:12:25, Long just two seconds back.</p>



<p>Laidlow would eventually finish nearly 30 minutes behind, helped along by match 11’s Gustav Iden.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 1 / US – 3.5 / INT – 4.5</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Lionel Sanders</strong></p>



<p>“Not bad for a couple of duathletes! It was deeply personal for me too. I told Sam, let’s put this guy in his place. I like Sam Laidlow but I think it got too personal, so I think we were on the same team on this one.</p>



<p>“This is totally next level. We were both here last year and it’s going in the right direction and we’re showing the world and people are excited about it.”</p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Sam Long</strong></p>



<p>“I had absolutely no option but to back this up. The song in my head was Aretha Franklin R. E. S. P. E. C. T. When Lionel and I are working together the strategy is to inflict as much pain on each other as possible.</p>



<p>“Better just to do what you got to do and get the job done.</p>



<p>“I think he learnt his lesson here and think some respect is due but the race is done, we’ll have a beer and we’ll become friends and Sam will have to buy all of the rounds!”</p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Sam Laidlow</strong></p>



<p>“I knew I’d come out with a lead on the swim but I got onto the bike and my stomach wasn’t taking on any nutrition. I don’t want to make excuses but it just wasn’t my day. Once I stopped for the toilet four or five times, towards the end I started to feel OK again so there’s still hope I guess!</p>



<p>“They beat me and were better today. There will be other races. I can’t predict how I would have done it if it wasn’t for that, they were just better guys today. I&#8217;m definitely hungry to have another shot, it’s just fuel to the fire. I’ll be back.</p>



<p>“I appreciated that [the embrace] and their respect. They’ve got more experience than me and achieved a lot more, so it was nice to share some kind words even after my failure.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 9</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Magnus Ditlev (EUR) vs Rudy Von Berg (US) vs Max Neumann (INT)</strong></p>



<p>It was no surprise to see Aussie Max Neumann lead from the water with Team US’s Rudy Von Berg right behind. What was a surprise was the stellar swim of Team Europe’s Magnus Ditlev, the Danish superstar just 18-seconds adrift.</p>



<p>Ditlev was in the lead by 20km into the bike and had built a gap of 1:26 by halfway to Von Berg and 3:38 to Neumann. The Dane’s advantage was 3:49 at the start of the run, a lead that would only grow. By 9km in, Ditlev was over five minutes clear of the American with Neumann struggling more than 12 minutes back.</p>



<p>Continuing to stride towards the finish, Ditlev crossed the line in 3:13:31, taking maximum points 7:20 ahead of Von Berg and 11:20 ahead of Neumann.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 3 / INT – 1</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 10</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Patrick Lange (EUR) vs Jason West (US) vs Aaron Royle (INT)</strong></p>



<p>Aaron Royle was another Team International athlete to create a gap in the water, the Aussie besting Patrick Lange and Jason West by nearly two-and-a-half minutes. By halfway, that lead was still holding at 2:39 to Lange (who had a 10-second penalty due to crossing the bike mount line early) and 3:28 to West.</p>



<p>By T2, Royle had edged out his lead to Lange while West lost more time, coming off the bike more than six minutes down. Showcasing the talent that had bagged him a Captains’ Pick for Team International, Royle cruised ahead while Lange suffered, West gaining moving to second after halfway.</p>



<p>Royle stormed to a powerful win in 3:17:30, 4:52 ahead of West with Lange bringing it in – Team Europe’s victory confirmed – 6:24 behind.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 1 / US – 2 / INT – 5.5</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Aaron Royle</strong></p>



<p>“I think especially for me I prefer a bit of a dynamic course where there are some hills so it made for a really hard day. I knew I had to swim hard which I did and when I put myself in that position I knew there’s no looking back now. At times it’s just playing with your mind that you’re starting to slow down or they’ll start catching you. And thinking they are catching you when you turn around on those long straights and seem closer than they are.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 11</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Gustav Iden (EUR) vs Matt Hanson (US) vs Jackson Laundry (INT)</strong></p>



<p>Gustav Iden and Matt Hanson were neck and neck in the water, keeping Team US in the game. Meanwhile, Jackson Laundry was 1:27 behind – a rare slower swim for Team International. It didn’t take long for Iden to assert his dominance – 1:23 ahead at 20km, 2:21 at 40km and 4:57 by the dismount line.</p>



<p>On the run, he was imperious, his natural running style propelling him to maximum points. Along the way, Iden collected fellow Team Europe member Sam Laidlow, who’d rallied to hold with the Norwegian’s pace.</p>



<p>Iden took the tape in 3:11:32, the winning streak of his lucky hat intact, 7:46 ahead of Hanson and 21:16 ahead of Laundry, who fought valiantly to reach the finish line.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 3.5 / INT – 1</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 12</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Daniel Baekkegard (EUR) vs Chris Leiferman (US) vs Braden Currie (INT)</strong></p>



<p>True to form, Daniel Baekkegard put in a storming swim to give himself an advantage of 42 seconds to Braden Currie and 3:01 to Chris Leiferman.</p>



<p>From there, it was a solo day for the Dane, who ripped through the bike course to extend his advantage to 5:14 and 9:12 on the Team International and Team US athletes respectively.</p>



<p>There was no way back for Baekkegard’s competitors during the 18km run as the Team Europe athlete didn’t let up for a second to ensure maximum points in the final match. Baekkegard crossed the finish line to close out the Collins Cup in 3:13:52, 7:48 ahead of Currie and 10:49 clear of Leiferman.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 1 / INT – 2.5</em></p>

<p>The inaugural PTO Canadian Open promised to take the sport to the next level and just as with <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/news/ashleigh-gentle-wins-pto-candian-open/"">the women&#8217;s race</a>, the men&#8217;s event delivered all the action, thrills and emotion to take triathlon up a notch. With a $1m prize purse and $100,000 on the line for the winner, it was a hotly fought contest with the world&#8217;s best athletes fighting it out for victory.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">How It Played Out</h2>



<p>Henri Schoeman – a wildcard entry to this race making a bid for a Collins Cup slot – quickly formed the point of the spear in the swim. The South African broke away to lead a pack of six including Australian wildcard <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/aaron-royle"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Aaron Royle</a> (PTO World #100), the USA’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-kanute"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ben Kanute</a> (PTO World #18), GBR’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/alistair-brownlee"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Alistair Brownlee</a>, France’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-laidlow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Sam Laidlow</a> (PTO World #20) and New Zealand’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kyle-smith"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Kyle Smith</a> (PTO World #25).</p>



<p>Pre-race favourites <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kristian-blummenfelt"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Kristian Blummenfelt</a> (PTO World #1) and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Gustav Iden</a> (PTO World #3) were in the second pack, over a minute behind by the end of the swim along with <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/frederic-funk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Frederic Funk</a> (PTO World #28). Meanwhile, Canadian favourite <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Lionel Sanders</a> mounted his bike with 4:06 to make up, having been dropped in the swim and putting in the day’s slowest transition.</p>



<p>Brownlee quickly found the front on the bike and began putting the chasers under pressure with Sam Laidlow the only athlete to hold with the Brit. By halfway on the bike, Laidlow and Brownlee had a lead of 47 seconds to Smith with Iden and Blummenfelt now sat in fourth and fifth at 1:32 back, beginning to eat into their deficit. Sanders had lost more time at 4:13 but having moved up from 34th to 20th on the course.</p>



<p>Iden continued to push the pedals hard in the bike’s closing stages, reducing the deficit to the leaders to 1:02 as he ran out of transition having brought Blummenfelt and Funk along for the ride, with Royle another 20 seconds back in sixth and Sanders in 11th with 3:19 to make up.</p>



<p>Laidlow began the run at a ferocious pace, immediately dropping the British double-Olympic champion. Behind, Iden and Blummenfelt were running shoulder-to-shoulder taking chunks of time out of the leaders. Before long, Alistair Brownlee was reduced to a walk as he grimaced holding his sides. The Yorkshireman would battle gamely on but end the day in 24th place.</p>



<p>After the Norwegian pair overtook Laidlow, the drama continued as early in the second lap as Blummentfelt suddenly stopped running holding a cramp in his hip. He would get going again but the world number one would lose around 1:30 to his countryman in the process.</p>



<p>Then, another victim of cramp – Laidlow was forced to hobble to the nearest Precision Fuel and Hydration station before being able to pick the pace up again.</p>



<p>Coming onto the final lap, Iden remained in the lead but a recovered Blummenfelt was running quicker, steadily closing the gap. Royle was in third, three minutes down, with Laidlow in fourth and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/pieter-heemeryck"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Pieter Heemeryck</a> in fifth ahead of Funk. Meanwhile, Sanders, off the bike in 11th, was up to seventh.</p>



<p>Hitting the finishing straight, Iden broke into a smile, high-fiving fans to take the tape only to collapse exhausted to the ground, $100,000 richer and the first-ever PTO Canadian Open Champion.</p>



<p>Blummenfelt was second, only 27 seconds behind – securing $70,000 and a Norwegian one-two. Aaron Royle took third and a $50,000 paycheck – a big statement to the Team Internationals Collins Cup captains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laidlow hung tough for fourth and $40,000 while Funk’s late surge put him in fifth to take $35,000 ahead of Heemeryck’s sixth-place, $30,000 finish – all three attention-grabbing performances making selection tough for the Team Europe Collins Cup captains.</p>



<p>Sanders finished the day in seventh place, battling on through a less-than-perfect day to take home $25,000.</p>

The post Ashleigh Gentle Wins PTO Candian Open appeared first on PTO .",https://protriathletes.org/news/rss,"<p>Australia&#8217;s Ashleigh Gentle wins the PTO Canadian Open to claim $100,000 ahead of Canada&#8217;s Paula Findlay and the USA&#8217;s Chelsea Sodaro.</p>



<p>With one of the strongest women&#8217;s fields ever assembled, the PTO Canadian Open promised stellar performances and didn&#8217;t disappoint with Paula Findlay dominating the bike and Ashleigh Gentle smashing the run to take the tape ahead of the Canadian. Meanwhile, Chelsea Sodaro finished strong in a tightly-fought battle to claim the final podium spot.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">How It Played Out</h2>



<p>In the swim, Vittoria Lopes quickly found the front, creating a gap on the second pack including Sarah Perez Sala (PTO World #22), Lauren Brandon (PTO World #53), Julie Derron (World #48) and Ashleigh Gentle (PTO World #17).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continuing to push the swim hard, Lopes had a significant lead but accidentally cut one of the swim buoys meaning she incurred a 30 second penalty. Even so, the Brazilian had clear water behind her and headed onto the bike and out of transition in pole position after a 27:26 swim.</p>



<p>By the end of lap one on the bike, Paula Findlay (PTO World #10) had moved from 10th to second with Lopes in sight. Findlay, recent winner of the Canadian National Time Trial Championships, was soon leading and pushing hard to distance all competitors.</p>



<p>With 40km done, Findlay came through transition with a smile, her lead was 1:06 to Gentle, Ellie Salthouse (PTO World #23), Nicola Spirig (PTO World #15) and Lopes. Further back, PTO World #8 Emma Pallant-Browne, a pre-race favourite, was forced out of the race with a front flat tyre. Meanwhile, Jocelyn McCauley (PTO World #21) was riding alone 2:08 back with Laura Philipp (PTO World #3) at 2:40 behind Findlay.</p>



<p>By the end of lap three, Findlay was enjoying a lead of 1:34 to the same pack of chasers, McCauley and Philipp losing a few more seconds. As she returned to a cheering crowd at the end of the 80km bike course, the Canadian’s buffer was up to two minutes over Jocelyn McCauley, who bossed the bike to reach T2 in second.</p>



<p>Over the four-lap 18km run, Findlay held a strong pace but Ashleigh Gentle – in second by 1.3km – was the fastest mover on the course. While Findlay wasn’t slowing, Gentle was on a flyer catching the Canadian around 7km in.</p>



<p>Behind, Laura Philipp was up into third place but looked to be working hard. Meanwhile, Chelsea Sodaro (PTO World #20), 10th off the bike, was ripping through the field and came right up to Philipp’s shoulder by 14km in.</p>



<p>Gentle, looking imperious, continued to drive her advantage, coming home in 3:30:53 with a 1:03:17 run – the day’s fastest – to become the inaugural PTO Canadian Open Champion and claim the $100,000 first-place prize purse. Starting the race as PTO World #17, this historic win is sure to boost her standing and secure an automatic qualification spot on Team Internationals for the Collins Cup, which is set for 20 August in Slovakia.</p>



<p>Feeding off the home crowd, Findlay finished second in 3:33:16, high-fiving the roaring fans to secure second place and take $70,000 – far more than the win in virtually any other race. In doing so, the Canadian secured the one-two for Team Internationals – hinting that they could pose a bigger threat at this year&#8217;s Collins Cup than in 2021, when the team received the Broken Spoke for coming third.</p>



<p>In the final 500m, Sodaro put her track-running background to great effect in breaking away from Philipp to take the final podium spot in 3:34:56 and a cheque for $50,000. That superb run performance from the Team US athlete should also worry Team Europe at the Collins Cup!</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Pro Women On The Race</h2>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Ashleigh Gentle</h3>



<p>&#8220;I just had the most amazing day today,&#8221; said Gentle. &#8220;It hasn’t been the easiest two or three years and I’m just grateful for all of the people that kept believing in me. I’m really proud of myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn’t start the sport of triathlon because of money but I have bills to pay, I’m an adult and the opportunity that the PTO has given us here is one I’m incredibly grateful for.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Paula Findlay</h3>



<p>&#8220;Honestly racing at home I was more nervous than I’ve ever been, more nervous than the Olympics or anything because I had all this support behind me and I didn’t want to disappoint anyone,&#8221; said Findlay.</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew I was fit, I knew I was healthy but you never know what’s going to happen on the day… of course I wanted to win, but there couldn’t be a more deserving champion. Ash is such a classy runner and I’m just so happy I could hold on for second.</p>



<p>&#8220;Seeing all my family and friends on the course and my mom – putting this race on and how much work she’s done just to get all this together – is amazing. So thanks to Do North for setting this up and just having a safe race, PTO for putting this on – it’s such an honour to race at home and I had the most fun ever.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Chelsea Sodaro</h3>



<p>&#8220;For context, I have really struggled with my mental health, actually, since having my daughter 16 months ago,&#8221; said Sodaro. &#8220;I keep on thinking, ‘I’m good!’ and then I have these little moments where I realise I am human and it’s still something that I need to work on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I had a full-blown panic attack during the first lap of the swim. I seriously contemplated dropping out during that lap and then I was like, ‘Just make it another lap, just make it another lap.’&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Sodaro’s run that really made the difference today. &#8220;This is the first time honestly I have felt like myself since giving birth while running. I used to be a pretty good runner and I just think it’s finally coming back so I am truly shocked that I am on the podium today… I hope that I made my little baby super proud today.&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking about her motherhood and the PTO Maternity Policy, Sodaro added: &#8220;I found out about the maternity policy when I was five or six months pregnant… it actually made me quite emotional because it’s 2022 but we still have so far to go in the way that we support women.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But this initiative – it says that the PTO cares about women, it cares about female athletes, it cares about keeping us in the sport and seeing us through all the phases of our athletic career… Women peak in our mid to late 30s in this long stuff and so we need the opportunity to be able to stay in the sport and we shouldn’t have to choose between being world-class athletes and being moms – we can do both, we just need some support.&#8221;</p>

As Kristian Blummenfelt said in the Race Week video series – for the winner it’s 100k for $100k.  Live coverage of the race starts at 10:30am local time (16:30 UTC). If you’re in Europe or the Indian Subcontinent, the race will be broadcast live exclusively on Eurosport. For the rest of the world, you can watch either via desktop or app on PTO+. Check out our How To Watch page for full listings.  As well as deep competition with one of the best fields we’ve ever seen lining up, the race course itself will add a huge challenge on the bike once the athletes leave the water after 2km in Hawrelak Park Lake. Technical with four laps featuring tight turns, sharp climbs and fast descents, there isn’t a moment of let-up or the chance for athletes to get their heads down over the 80km course. On the run, it’s four laps again, the mixed terrain and wooded setting providing a beautifully fast finish.  The men’s race has an abundance of talent, all striving to clinch the first PTO Tour title in history. Here’s a run-down of some of the highest-ranked athletes to watch out for.  PTO World #1 Kristian Blummenfelt has almost conquered triathlon in just two seasons. The Olympic Champion, IM world champ and World Triathlon Champion will be seeking to add the PTO Canadian Open to his prestigious palmares.  Fellow Norwegian Gustav Iden (PTO World #3) is likely to be Blummenfelt’s biggest competition. The two-time 70.3 world champion and PTO 2020 Championship winner is undefeated at middle distance racing. “It’s not like you forget you’re friends out there,” said Iden of his training partner during the press conference. “But I think the will to win is quite strong in both of us. So I don’t think we’ll give each other too much slack towards the end of the race. I guess, at the start, maybe, but when things get really tough towards the last few Ks of the run, I think all logic just goes out the window and you just want to finish first.”  Lionel ‘No Limits’ Sanders (PTO World #5) might be Canadian but he trains ‘Norwegian style’ under coach Mikal Iden (brother of Gustav). He was clear what beating Iden and Blummenfelt would mean to him: “These guys to my right – and Brownlee as well, obviously – are the best guys in the world, truly. So it would mean more than anything I’ve accomplished in my career, most definitely.  “It’s not that fun finishing second, I’ve got lots of seconds. I would like to be gunning for the win so there’s only one way to do it and it’s to absolutely destroy the bike. Yes the back-half of the run gets extremely painful because of it, but that’s part of the game plan.”  Matt Hanson moved up to PTO World #10 after a sensation race at IM Des Moines where the US athlete showed he could bike with the best of them, taking the day’s fastest split. Add in the astonishing run pace he showed at the PTO 2020 Championship and Hanson is not one to be underestimated.  Jackson Laundry (PTO World #17) will be wanting to take the top spot and beat fellow Canadian Sanders into the bargain. He’s already achieved that feat once this season at 70.3 Oceanside, so the rest of the field is sure to watch him closely in this home-soil race.  Ben Kanute (PTO World #18) is one of the sport’s most versatile athletes and is sure to feature throughout the day. A veteran of World Triathlon competition – and the technical ability that goes with it – the course could suit Kanute perfectly making him a real threat.  The depth of field far from stops there with up-and-comer Sam Laidlow (PTO World #20) knocking on the door of a world-beating performance, plus the triple threat from down under of Australia’s Max Neumann (PTO World #23), Sam Appleton (PTO World #24) and Kiwi (PTO World #25).  While he’s not highly ranked right now having not raced for a while, no-one will be underestimating double Olympic Champion Alistair Brownlee, who was a late entrant to the event. “I feel healthy, although maybe not that fit,” said Brownlee. “I’m absolutely delighted to be here. I’m happy to be injury free and looking forward to racing as hard as I can and just enjoying it. I also think it’s a great opportunity to support this first event of the PTO Tour, which I think is a fantastic project and I felt like it was important to be here from that aspect as well.  “I’ve been a triathlete since I was eight years old and when I was 16 I remember [being] sat in a careers class in school… you’re going along the table: I want to be a brain surgeon, I want to be a lawyer or whatever, and I said, ‘I want to be a professional triathlete,’ and the teacher said, ‘Is that even possible, boy?’ And I said, ‘I don’t know to be honest but I’m going to give it a go.  “Nearly 20 years later, I have managed to be a professional triathlete. But still, I think there’s a long way that triathlon can go in terms of commercialising the sport and providing opportunities for exposure and earning for elite athletes, especially in the long-distance side of it. There are some phenomenal athletes and I think there are great stories to be told, there are great athletes to watch and for fans to follow and there needs to be a format to do that.

<p>With 32 of the world’s top-ranked women battling to earn a slice of the $1m prize purse – the winner will earn a cool $100,000 – plus the chance to take a historical first-ever PTO Tour title, there’s a lot on the line this weekend.</p>



<p>Live coverage of the race starts at 10:30am local time (16:30 UTC). If you’re in Europe or the Indian Subcontinent, the race will be broadcast live exclusively on <a href=""https://www.eurosport.co.uk/triathlon/pto-tour/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Eurosport</a>.

<p>The race course is far from straightforward with laps, hills and sharp turns to contend with. After the three-lap 2km swim in Hawrelak Park Lake, it’s on to an unforgiving four-lap bike course that’ll test athletes’ ability to climb, descend, corner and maintain focus. With few chances to find a rhythm, we could see a different dynamic during the bike leg than is typical on less technical courses. The run is also four laps, the flat, out-and-back course giving chasers plenty of opportunities to judge their gains as they close on the leaders.</p>



<p>The women’s race boasts one of the deepest fields ever assembled. Here’s a run-down of some of the highest-ranked athletes to watch out for.</p>



<p>Topping the list is PTO World #3 <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Laura Philipp</a>. Nothing short of an absolute racing machine, the German star set a new world-best time for the 70.3 distance in March and came achingly close to doing the same at the full distance in Hamburg last month. Forced to sit out the IM world champs due to Covid, Philipp is raring to take a big title and is certainly a race favourite.</p>



<p>Next up is PTO World #7 <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Skye Moench</a> who races for the USA but actually began life in Canada. Though more attuned to the full distance, Moench’s sheer power means she remains a threat in any race.</p>



<p>Britain’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/emma-pallant"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Emma Pallant-Browne</a> (PTO World #8) is one of the best middle-distance athletes the sport has ever seen and has already clocked four wins this season. “It’s an incredible event, an incredible thing to be a part of the first one,” said Pallant-Browne during the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pMgHX5GM4g"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Canadian Open press conference</a>. “To win… I don’t think there are many words to describe it. The quality of the fields here – there’s so many people with so much potential and it’s going to make for a really exciting event.”</p>



<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jeanni-metzler"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jeanni Metzler</a> (PTO World #9) proved herself a stellar racer with a savage run in 2021. The South African is on the comeback trail after striving to overcome mental health issues during the winter but that doesn’t make her any less a danger to the competition.</p>



<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Paula Findlay</a> (PTO World #10) hails from Edmonton – her mother, Sheila is the race director! – so this hometown hero has both the pressure and confidence which comes with that. “I’m trying not to let [the pressure] really get to me and try to use it more as excitement than nerves,” said Findlay at the press conference. “It’s really cool to be back in Edmonton… I know the roads really well and it’s really fun to see my face and Lionel’s face all over the city on the banners… and I’m just trying to use that to get me excited to race.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a really unique course. It’s very technical… it kind-of looks like a World Cup ITU circuit with lots of corners, lots of climbing, lots of descending. So I think it’ll make for an interesting race and no-one knows what to expect so it’s a cool course.” Indeed, Findlay’s background in short-course racing gives her even more of an edge this weekend.</p>



<p>Beyond these top-five-ranked athletes, the depth-in-strength just keeps rolling. There’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/fenella-langridge"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Fenella Langridge</a>, up to PTO World #11 after a stellar second-place performance in Roth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jackie-hering"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jackie Hering</a> (PTO World #12) will be gunning for the top spot but is keenly aware of the quality of field this first PTO Tour event has attracted. “I’m not going to lie, there’s an extremely intimidating list of people at this race,” said Hering. “I just think it’s amazing the amount of Olympians and champions… But it’s important for me to try not to think about that and just focus on my own race and controlling how I execute my race, which I do feel confident in doing, and just not worry about everyone else.”</p>



<p>Other athletes to contend with include <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/holly-lawrence"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Holly Lawrence</a> (PTO World #13); double Olympic medallist <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/nicola-spirig"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Nicola Spirig</a> (PTO World #15) and Australia’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ashleigh-gentle"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ashleigh Gentle</a> (PTO World #17) whose recent move from World Triathlon racing to long course should make her one to watch in Edmonton.</p>

<p>Backing up an incredibly strong women’s start list for the <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/canadian-open/"">PTO Canadian Open</a>, the men’s field by no means disappoints with the upper echelons of the male PTO World Rankings ready to do battle in Edmonton!</p>



<p>On Sunday 24 July it will be the men’s turn to do battle for a share of the $1m prize purse on offer as well as a 10% PTO points bonus on offer – a factor that could prove crucial as the event is also the last qualifying race for this year’s Collins Cup. This year’s Collins Cup qualification could prove even more competitive than last year’s so every point is going to fought for tooth and nail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PTO World #1 <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kristian-blummenfelt"">Kristian Blummenfelt</a> is the highest-ranked athlete set to start and will be joined by his Norwegian counterpart, colleague and competitor <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden"">Gustav Iden</a> (PTO World #2). This will be the first time that the two get to battle it out in a long-distance setting having previously chosen different races to each other or mechanical issues putting a stop to any all-out racing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Norwegian pair will also have the likes of the lion <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders"">Lionel Sanders</a> (PTO World #3) to contend with over the 100km course and he is hungry to take the Norwegians down a peg or two. Then comes a flurry of European stars all of whom will be targeting a spot of Team Europe at The Collins Cup; <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/daniel-baekkegard"">Daniel Bækkegård</a> (PTO World #5), <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/patrick-lange"">Patrick Lange</a> (PTO World #10) <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/magnus-elbaek-ditlev"">Magnus Ditlev</a> (PTO World #11) and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/joe-skipper"">Joe Skipper</a> (PTO World #13).</p>

The post PTO Canadian Open Women’s Field Announced appeared first on PTO .,https://protriathletes.org/news/rss,"<p>The women’s field for the first PTO Canadian Open has been announced and we’re in for some ferocious racing from a stacked start list.</p>



<p>With a veritable who’s who from the upper echelons of the PTO World Rankings set to do battle in Edmonton, the first <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/canadian-open/"">PTO Canadian Open</a> – which is also the inaugural PTO Tour event – is set to make history on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Come Saturday 23 July, not only will the women battle it out for a slice of a whopping $1m prize purse but there’s also a 10% PTO points bonus on offer – a factor that could prove crucial as the event is also the last qualifying race for this year’s Collins Cup. With competition for automatic Collins Cup qualification fierce, expect athletes vying for a spot on Team Europe, Team US and Team International to fight for every place right down the field.</p>



<p>So, who are some of the names you can look forward to seeing at the PTO Canadian Open?</p>



<p>PTO World #2 <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Laura Philipp</a> of Germany is the highest-ranked athlete set to start but will face tough competition from the likes of the American duo <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/taylor-knibb"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Taylor Knibb</a> (PTO World #6) and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Skye Moench</a> (PTO World #7), Britain’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/emma-pallant"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Emma Pallant-Browne</a> (PTO World #8), South Aftrica’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jeanni-metzler"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jeanni Metzler</a> (PTO World #9) and Edmonton hometown hero <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Paula Findlay</a> (PTO World #10).</p>



<p>And that’s just the top 10! Other in-form contenders at the 100km distance include the USA’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jackie-hering"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jackie Hering</a> (PTO World #11) Britain’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/holly-lawrence"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Holly Lawrence</a> (PTO World #12), American <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Chelsea Sodaro</a> (PTO World #17) Canada’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/tamara-jewett"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Tamara Jewett</a> (PTO World #18), Spain’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sara-perez-sala"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Sara Perez Sala</a> (PTO World #20) and the Aussie one-two of <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ellie-salthouse"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ellie Salthouse</a> (PTO World #21) and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ashleigh-gentle"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ashleigh Gentle</a> (PTO World #24).</p>



<p>One other name to keep in mind is PTO World #3 <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-haug"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Anne Haug</a>, who’s playing her cards close to her chest ahead of her race at Challenge Roth this weekend. If she does make it to Edmonton, she’s surely one to watch.</p>



<div class=""pto-embed"" data-src=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/race/pto-tour-/2022/participants/FPRO/embed""></div><script async="""" src=""https://platform.protriathletes.org/embed.js""></script>



<p>In terms of the Collins Cup, the PTO Canadian Open could prompt movement in automatic qualifications, especially for Team US and Team International. With Heather Jackson not racing and Chelsea Sodaro and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jocelyn-mccauley"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jocelyn McCauley</a> (PTO World #19) just a couple of points behind, one of them could nab that fourth qualifying spot for Team US.</p>



<p>For Team International, Jeanni Metzler just needs a race finish to solidifiy her top-place on the team but slots three and four – currently occupied by Tamara Jewett and Ellite Salthouse – could be threatened by strong races from Brazil’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/luisa-baptista"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Luisa Baptista</a> (PTO World #23) and Ashleigh Gentle, who are just two points shy apiece.</p>



<p>For Team Europe, things are a little more set with the top four PTO World Ranked athletes holding the same positions for the Collins Cup. With the 10% bonus on offer in Edmonton, an absolutely stellar performance from Emma Pallant-Browne might just oust Kat Matthews but it’s a big ask!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more on the PTO Canadian Open including the men’s field and wildcard athlete reveals!</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Women’s Sub8 Contenders</h3>



<p>Like Sub7, the Sub8 teams didn’t have a smooth ride to the start line. 2012 Olympic Champion and 2016 Olympic silver medal winner Nicola Spirig crashed hard in February, coming off her bike to break her collarbone and some ribs as well as puncturing her lung. The gritty Swiss star put all that behind her to take on the challenge of Sub8 in her final professional year.</p>



<p>PTO World #5 and reigning IM 70.3 World Champion&nbsp;<a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lucy-charles-barclay"">Lucy Charles-Barclay</a>&nbsp;was initially slated to face off against Spirig but a stress fracture of the hip meant giving way to fellow Brit, Kat Matthews, in April. Matthews, second at the Ironman World Championship in May and perhaps the long-course world’s preeminent bike-runner has had a rapid rise in the sport, boasting a ferocious 2:49:48 Ironman marathon best.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Sub8 Race</h3>



<p>Both women opted for two swim pacers and after initially leading, Spirig was overhauled by Matthews in the closing stages. By the end, the pair finished the first leg only seven seconds apart after 3.8km in the water, just shy of 55 minutes.</p>



<p>Matthews and her team quickly made time on the bike, but the gap to Spirig didn’t balloon too far, settling in just below four minutes. That buffer eventually came down to around three minutes as Matthews’ pace lowered in the closing stages of the 180km course around the Dekra Lausitzring track.</p>



<p>With a 2:37 marathon PB, that was a deficit many thought Spirig could erase – and initially, that looked to be the case. Slowly reeling in Matthews, Spirig made the catch with around 14km to go but the Brit kept the Swiss superfrau in her sights and kept her cool to repass 3km later and build a convincing lead.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" src=""https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sub7Sub8-kat-matthews-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""Kat Matthews at Sub7Sub8"" class=""wp-image-23044"" srcset=""https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sub7Sub8-kat-matthews-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sub7Sub8-kat-matthews-300x200.jpg 300w, https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sub7Sub8-kat-matthews-768x512.jpg 768w, https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sub7Sub8-kat-matthews.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /><figcaption>Photo: James Mitchell</figcaption></figure>



<p>Matthews remained metronomic in her pace, holding strong for a 2:46:09 marathon time and an overall finish of 7:31:54 – within a minute of her goal time. Spirig dug deep to clock a faster marathon time than the Brit – 2:45 – and crossed the line in 7:34:19.</p>



<p>While pre-race pundits postulated that the Sub8 barrier would be the easier to take down – Chrissie Wellington’s iron-distance world-best at Roth standing at 8:18 – the margin by which both women smashed that mark was astonishing and inspiring in equal measure.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Men’s Sub7 Contenders</h3>



<p>When the idea for Sub7Sub8 was announced, there were many raised eyebrows about the inclusion of Blummenfelt, who, at the time, was yet to complete an iron-distance race. A couple of seasons on, the Norwegian took to the start line of Sub7 in Germany as world number one, World Triathlon Champion, Olympic Champion and Ironman World Champion, proving doubters wrong at every turn.</p>



<p>A six-time full-distance champ, Skipper joined Sub7 just eight days from the race start after dual Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee bowed out due to a stress reaction injury. In gamely jumping in, the Brit certainly gained some new fans while cementing his position as the ‘junkyard’ underdog.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Sub7 Race</h3>



<p>Each with a single swim pacer in Lars Botellier for Blummenfelt and Alistair Brownlee for Skipper, the Norwegian drew first blood, besting the Brit by five minutes out of the water. Once on the bike though, the power and discipline of the team put together by Brownlee – including former hour-record holder Alex Dowsett – shone through.</p>



<p>Storming past Blummenfelt, Skipper gave the Olympic champ his trademark junkyard dog bark, the team going on to an astonishing 3:16 bike split, some eight minutes quicker than Blummenfelt’s squad and clocking over 55kmph average. There was also a hairy moment for the world number one along the way when a touch of wheels in the group nearly sent them down like a pack of dominoes.</p>



<p>On the marathon, Skipper put in an exceptional effort but even a stunning 2:36 run wasn’t enough to hold off the Norwegian’s advance. Woofing back at Skipper as he passed around 17km in, Blummenfelt steamrollered to victory with a 2:30 marathon, crossing the line in 6:44:25 while Skipper came home in 6:47:36 – both comfortably under the seven-hour mark.</p>



<p id=""blummenfelt-video"">While Sub7Sub8 might not result in any new official records, it was certainly one of the most compelling and entertaining triathlon events of recent years. Let’s hope we get to see more athletes take on similar challenges in the future to push the barriers of human performance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we know what Blummenfelt is up to next as the Norwegian powerhouse confirmed his intention to race at the <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/canadian-open/"">PTO Canadian Open</a> on 24 July. There’s just a month to go to <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/canadian-open/"">enter the event yourself</a> – so you can race an iconic course, then hit the grandstand to see Blummenfelt do his thing!</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Laura Philipp Makes A Statement In Hamburg</h2>



<p>Going into last weekend, we thought all the references to Chrissie Wellington’s world-best iron-distance time of 8:18:13 would be reserved for Sub8 but while Matthews and Spirig were being paced around a race track, PTO World #3&nbsp;<a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp"">Laura Philipp</a>&nbsp;was putting together a devastating performance at IM Hamburg.</p>



<p>A quick check on&nbsp;<a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/race/im-hamburg/2021/results"">previous years’ results at IM Hamburg</a>&nbsp;showed a women’s course record of 8:54:30 – set in 2021 by Laura Zimmermann – where the AIT (Adjusted Ideal Time) was 8:43:19. With that in mind, it seemed unlikely that we’d see super-fast times despite Philipp’s pedigree and the event’s European Championship status. How wrong we were!</p>



<p>Finding the feet of iron-rookie&nbsp;<a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro"">Chelsea Sodaro</a>&nbsp;(now moved up 13 places to PTO World #17), Philipp and the American left the water together just ahead of France’s&nbsp;<a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/manon-genet"">Manon Genet</a>&nbsp;(PTO World #32). Once on the bike, Philipp pushed hard to gap Sodaro – and had to, as the US star chased hard over her maiden 180km and would only lose four minutes by T2. Philipp posted a staggering bike split of 4:31:14, one of the fastest ever seen in the sport.</p>

<p>Leaving transition, Philipp showed zero after-effects of the tough Covid bout that kept her from the IM world champs in St. George. Simply sensational throughout the run, German bounded around the course to a mind-blowing 2:45:38 marathon for an 8:18:20 finish. That’s just seven seconds shy of Chrissie Wellington’s world best time with a run split that bettered Kat Matthews’ Sub8 attempt.</p>



<p>Sodaro came home with an impressive first iron-distance time of 8:36 while Genet rounded out the podium in 8:52.</p>



<p>The result is a huge score of 115.08 PTO World Rankings Points for Philipp, which, with the addition of a 10% bonus for her single best iron-distance performance of the year, put her score at 126.59 meaning she jumped two places in the rankings up to PTO World #2.</p>



<p>This sets the stage for the rest of the season with Philipp yet to face PTO World #1 and recently crowned Ironman World Champion, <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-ryf"">Daniela Ryf</a> – a matchup we could see at the <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/canadian-open/"">PTO Canadian Open</a> in July before the pair are likely to join forces for Team Europe at the <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/collins-cup/"">Collins Cup</a> in August!</p>

<p class=""p1"">The inaugural PTO Pro Am showcased the sizzling speed and spectacular strength of PTO professionals, Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF) athletes and amateur special guests with Team Sanders coming out on top ahead of Team Baekkegard and Team Long. There were plenty of spine-tingling moments as the athletes moved through swim, bike and run from Venice Beach to Downtown.</p>
<p class=""p1"">You can watch the full race replay below or scroll on to read the race highlights.</p>

<h3 class=""p1"">How The PTO Pro Am Played Out</h3>
<p class=""p1"">The swim was dominated by three-time Paralympian Chris Hammer (Team Jackson) and 2019 World Para Swimming Championships silver medallist Ahalya Lettenberger (Team Chura), the two trading the lead over the 1500m swim. It was Hammer who made the tag first, passing to Heather Jackson with Haley Chura leaving T1 close behind. Haven Shepherd put in a fantastic swim to minimise the deficit, giving Lionel Sanders just a couple of minutes to make up to the women. Emily Gray was next back to the beach, giving Sam Long a shot to chase down his rival. Next, Allysa Seely passed the baton to Daniel Baekkegard before Jamal Hill tagged in Skye Moench.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Jackson hung tough at the front but the catch from Sanders, reigning Canadian Hour Record holder, was an inevitability. There wasn’t even a glance to his competitor as Sanders passed, full of determination. Ripping through the 40km bike course, the reigning Canadian Hour Record holder had extended his lead by the time he reached Downtown LA and T2.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">With Sanders tagging former UFC star Paul Felder into the action at the front of the race, Daniel Baekkegard caught Sam Long just before transition, meaning Modern Pentathlon Olympic silver medallist Heather Fell (Team Baekkegard) and five-time Paralympic medallist Rudy Garcia-Tolson (Team Long) started the run just steps apart. Further back, Team Jackson was out of the race after Heather Jackson suffered a blown tyre on the bike.</p>
<p class=""p1"">At the front, Felder was gunning for a new 10km PB, storming up the hills and pushing right to the line to ensure Team Sanders’ victory and the first-ever PTO Pro Am title. Despite a wrong turn between run laps, Heather Fell showed fantastic form – no-doubt honed by a never-ending stream of GTN challenges – to secure silver for Team Baekkegard. Rudy Garcia-Tolson, classy as ever, completed the podium for Team Long. That put Team Chura in fourth after an anchor leg from Roderick Sewell and Team Moench in fifth, Dr Kent Bradley taking it to the line.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Winner’s Quotes</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Interviewed by <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/news/pto-pro-am-los-angeles-how-to-watch-live/"">new PTO presenter Rachel Stringer</a>, Team Sanders were clearly buzzed by the event and their victory.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“I knew they had assembled a strong team because we were going to dominate this event from start to finish,” said Sanders. “Haven got us a big lead and then I just tried to hang on to it and then Paul brought it home so it was a lot of fun… It was a full-blown competition. I knew I’d be out here trying to compare my bike time to the pros and to Sam Long and to Daniel [Baekkegard] so I rode as hard as I can and I’m excited to go look at the results and see where I stacked in the bike portion of the race.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“I would definitely say this is the greatest way to go into your late teens,” said Shepherd “I’d just turned 18 years old going into my Olympic Games and then being asked to do this triathlon with these guys… I was very thankful that they chose me to be on their team… I wanted to go out really nice and smooth but I definitely booked it on the way back to shore!”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“I didn’t do any course preview… the hills were for real out there. When you were going up that thing it was steep so I knew – OK, I could get sub-40… I ran hard and I got to run out there with all the pros and I had such a good start with these guys kicking it off for me so it was awesome.”</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Elite Race Results</h3>
<p class=""p1"">With $100,000 of PTO prize money up for grabs in the elite race, a fast swim and a strong bike legs from the USA’s Eric Lagerstrom and South Africa’s Jamie Riddle put these two at the front of the race by T2 with just over a minute’s lead to Australia’s Steve McKenna. Pushing the pace towards the finish, it was Riddle who kicked ahead to score the victory with Lagerstrom second and McKenna third.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the women’s race, Brazil’s Vittoria Lopes was first out the water, first off the bike and first across the line to claim the win. New Zealand’s Amelia Watkinson was next off the bike ahead of the USA’s Amy Sloan in third, positions that reversed to put the American in second and the Kiwi third by the finish.</p>

<h3>Daniela Ryf – Back To Her Best</h3>
<p>Unwell at Kona in 2019 and having struggled with immune system issues through lockdown, Daniela Ryf put together as perfect a long course performance as we&#8217;ve ever seen to score a whopping 124.6 points. Triathlon fandom was united in awe as the Angry Bird returned to her best with a goosebumps-raising exhibition of dominance.</p>
<p>Fourth out the water, Ryf was soon in the lead on the bike and stuck to the gameplan that had seen her take four IM world titles going into St. George – ride hard and then, when everyone else&#8217;s legs are burning, ride even harder. Leading by seven minutes at the start of the run, a sub-three-hour marathon created an almost nine-minute margin of victory to second place <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/katrina-matthews"">Kat Matthews</a> and 12 minutes to defending world champ, <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-haug"">Anne Haug</a>.</p>

<p>With an Adjusted Ideal Time (AIT) of 08:54:42, Ryf&#8217;s 8:34:58 finish was certainly worthy of her colossal points score, which saw her regain the lead in the PTO World Rankings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kat Matthews&#8217; second place saw her score 113.59 points to move up three places into PTO World #3. Anne Haug also moved up three spots, her 109.56 score seeing her move up into PTO World #2 just above Matthews.</p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench"">Skye Moench</a> (fourth in St. George) moved up one place to PTO World #7 while <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lisa-norden"">Lisa Norden</a> jumped five spots to PTO World #12. <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ruth-astle"">Ruth Astle</a> was the biggest mover, moving up 16 places to PTO World #15. Fellow Brit <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/fenella-langridge"">Fenella Langridge</a> improved by three places to take the PTO World #19 slot.</p>
<p>Of interest for the Collins Cup, the top five women in the world are all from Team Europe, putting the defending champions in the driving seat for Samorin in August.</p>
<h4>Kristian Blummenfelt – GOAT In The Making?</h4>
<p>With his win in St. George, Kristian Blummenfelt becomes the first reigning Olympic Champion to win an Ironman world title. The win came courtesy of a dominating run performance, the Norwegian clocking 2:38 on a challenging course in tough conditions.</p>

<p>Running at a fearsome pace, Blummenfelt took first around 28km into the marathon and victory looked assured from there. His finish of 7:49:15 – compared to that AIT of 08:00:02 – was worth 114.98 points. With that, Blummenfelt had a third high-scoring race to his name, seeing him rocket 41 places up the rankings, overtaking countryman Gustav Iden to take the coveted PTO World #1 spot.</p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/braden-currie"">Braden Currie</a>, third on the day in St. George, moved up 10 places to become PTO World #6 as well as take the second spot for Team International men in the Collins Cup standings.</p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/florian-angert"">Florian Angert</a> improved by four places to sit one place behind Currie as PTO World #7 while <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/leon-chevalier"">Leon Chevalier</a>&#8216;s breakthrough performance saw him move 16 places to PTO World #11. <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/chris-leiferman"">Chris Leiferman</a> jumped 25 spots to PTO World #13 and become second in the Team US standings for the Collins Cup. <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-laidlow"">Sam Laidlow</a> improved his ranking by 17 places and is now PTO World #16 with <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-hoffman"">Ben Hoffman</a> climbing six places to PTO World #18 – now fifth in the Team US rankings, just one spot from automatic qualification.</p>
<p>With lots more racing to come this season, there is still plenty of time for the rankings to move around, for athletes to secure Collins Cup qualification and to earn a bigger slice of the PTO&#8217;s $2,008,000 end-of-year bonus pool!</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The stage is set for the ‘Battle of Champions’ at the Ironman World Championships in St. George, Utah. This is the first time that the race will be held outside the island of Hawaii and provides a brand new and challenging course for the athletes to contend with.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The strength of both the men’s and women’s fields is seriously impressive with Olympic champions, multiple Kona winners, young blood and experienced veterans creating a plethora of athletes who could contend for the win or reach the podium.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, the lack of athletes including </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-frodeno""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jan Frodeno</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/patrick-lange""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Patrick Lange</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/joe-skipper""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joe Skipper</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Laura Philipp</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lucy-charles-barclay""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lucy Charles-Barclay</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> – unable to race due to injury or illness – will no doubt shake up the race dynamics as triathlon looks to crown its first IM world champ since October 2019.</span></p>
<h2><b>Men’s Race</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>The Norwegian Hype</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since transitioning to long course racing, superstars </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gustav Iden</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #1) and </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kristian-blummenfelt""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kristian Blummenfelt</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #42) have left a clear mark on the sport, with many suggesting they are now the ones to beat. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This will be Blummenfelt’s second ever full distance race, having previously only raced IM Cozumel where he set the world-best time over the distance. Iden has also only ever raced one full-distance race previously, IM Florida. Astonishing performances from both Norwegians in their first full-distance efforts made the triathlon world sit up and pay attention.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Norwegian pair will both likely come out of the water either at the back of the first swim pack or the front of the second and try to bridge up to the lead bikers early on. Even if either of them is 5-10 minutes back coming off the bike, their run prowess – having clocked 2:35 marathons on debut – will mean they are very much still in for a chance of the win. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>The Great Dane</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With a podium finish at the 70.3 World Championships last year and a proven track record over the full distance, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/daniel-baekkegard""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daniel Bækkegård</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #4) is undoubtedly a strong podium contender. As a strong swimmer, Bækkegård will be able to stick with the front swim pack and set himself up to be in the mix at the front of the race. </span></p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom:30px } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class=""embed-container""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJvbYKm6l_k&amp;t=719s"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The only possible question mark over Bækkegård in regards to his chances of winning is his run. Bækkegård’s best marathon to date is 2:45 (by no means slow), however, with the likes of Blummenflet, Iden as well as </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-van-berkel""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jan Van Berkel</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> all having clocked sub 2:40 marathons, the Dane would likely require a significant gap going into the run to hold them all off. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Alistair Brownlee</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At 70.3 Oceanside a little over a month ago, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/alistair-brownlee""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alistair Brownlee</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> proved that his longstanding injuries have been put to bed. Brownlee was expected by to wipe the floor with the competition in California but that certainly did not end up being the case. After leading for most of the run, Brownlee came home in a disappointing fourth behind a sensational </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jackson Laundry</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and that epic sprint finish between </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/rudy-von-berg""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rudy Von Berg</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and Lionel Sanders. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brownlee put it down to not being over a recent illness, so we can only hope that he has been able to recover fully so we can see him at his double-Olympic winning best. The Brit’s overall swim, bike and run prowess mean that if he is showing up healthy and measures his efforts accordingly he can absolutely be counted as a contender for the win. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>No Limits Lionel, Yo Yo Yo Sam Long and Catch me if you Cam Wurf</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></h3>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lionel Sanders</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #3), </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-long""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sam Long</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #5) and </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/cameron-wurf""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cam Wurf</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #31) are three athletes who are sure to provide excitement no matter the final race outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In classic Cam Wurf fashion, it was still unclear until </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPp_bPs-ELE""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">yesterday’s appearance on Breakfast with Bob</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> if he would be racing due to commitments to pro cycling team Ineos Grenadiers. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We can all say that we are thrilled to see Cam being able to make the race, including Sanders and Long who have both said how happy they are to have Wurf’s firepower on the bike. Wurf was always known to be one of the best cyclists in triathlon but over the past two years he has proven these credentials in pro cycling. Only last week Wurf could be seen leading out over the famous cobbles of Paris Roubaix, setting up an incredible win for his team. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sanders, Long and Wurf have all historically had similar swim abilities and have needed their strong bikes to allow them to bridge the gap to the lead group. This will be the case once more, though it will be fascinating to see what gains both Sanders and Long have been able to make in the swim having both focused heavily on improving this discipline.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For Sanders and Long it is about being amongst the lead group coming off the bike if they are to have hopes of winning. Though it is possible to make up some deficit on the run to some athletes, it would be a serious challenge to make inroads to the Norwegian duo with even a small deficit.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On paper, Sanders is the better runner and also has form in St. George having won the 70.3 there in May last year by outsprinting Long. On the other hand, Long took second at the 70.3 world – also in St. George – last September.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another athlete who could be in the mix with the chasing bike pack, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sebastian-kienle""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sebastian Kienle</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #36) is the only previous IM World Champion on the men’s side who has made it to the start line (with Lange and Frodeno both injured). Kienle announced he will retire at the end of 2023, making this his penultimate chance to bag another IM world title.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Though Kienle is in the latter stages of his career, this absolutely does not rule him out of podium contention. For Kienle, it will be important to minimise his deficit on the swim and then get to work on the bike, likely being surrounded by fellow uber bikers Sanders, Long and Wurf. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kienle has struggled with injury on and off for the last couple of years so we can only hope that he is fully healthy coming into this race and if he is able to come off the bike with or near the front of the race, there is absolutely no reason to rule him out of winning it all!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Other Contenders  </b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Already mentioned for his run abilities, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-van-berkel""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jan Van Berkel</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #30) could very well be one of those athletes we see working their way through the field late in the race and could very well have podium chances depending on what is happening around him. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The USA’s </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-hoffman""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ben Hoffman</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #24) has form at IM World Championships having clocked four top-10 finishes including second back in 2014. Hoffmann is also coming off a fantastic win at IM Texas two weeks ago, a performance that saw him rise a whipping 57 places in the PTO World Rankings.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/braden-currie""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Braden Currie</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #16), one of those athletes who loves the big stages and has previously been able to achieve fifth place finish in the world champs. Perhaps he will be able to improve on it this Saturday. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then there is </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kyle-smith""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kyle Smith</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #22), actually picked as one of Jan Frodeno’s favourites to be on the podium once everything has been left out on the course. Smith and Frodeno are training partners so if anyone has the inside track on the form that Smith is bringing into the race, it’d be the German star.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Women’s Race</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Daniela Ryf – Queen of St. George?</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With four Ironman world titles </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-ryf""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daniela Ryf</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #3) is known by many as the Queen of Kona, but will she also be crowned monarch of St. George this weekend? Ryf has won four IM World Championships, five 70.3 world titles and has dominated the sport for years. However, in recent months Ryf has had some disappointing performances (some would say out of character) where she would have typically been expected to dominate.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is no doubt that if Ryf is firing on all cylinders then she is undoubtedly one of the favourites to take the win. Her game plan is sure to be the same as in her other victories – </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">catching the leaders on the bike and then riding away from them to establish a large enough gap to hold off faster runners. If the likes of Haug, Matthews or anyone who can put in a strong run are level with Ryf at the start of the run then Ryf’s chances of victory will be significantly lowered. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Haug’s Title Defence</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After two years since the last IM World Championship, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-haug""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Anne Haug</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #5) is finally able to defend her title. The German has banked strong and consistent results over the last year despite battling with Covid-induced diabetes during 2021. Unlike many of her fellow athletes, she managed to stay injury-free, however.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In her most recent race at IM 70.3 Lanzarote in March, Haug finished second, four minutes behind Kat Matthews. Likely not the result that she would have wanted in her main build race going into St. George against one of her main competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Haug did say in her Breakfast with Bob interview this week that she had experimented with coming straight from an altitude camp to the Lanzarote race and could still feel the effects of altitude and the sluggishness in her system. Haug took this as a learning and adjusted the timing of her altitude camp leading into St. George – hopefully to good effect. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If Haug is to take the title, she will need to ride smart and run at her best. Making up a deficit on the run to most athletes is well within Haug’s ability but if the German gives away too much time to Matthews on the bike, closing on the fleet-footed Brit will be a big ask.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Kat Matthews’ Debut Champs</b></h3>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/katrina-matthews""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kat Matthews</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #6) has taken the triathlon world rather by storm since turning pro in 2019, impressing with podiums and wins including IM Florida in 2020 and IM UK in 2021 before winning 70.3 Lanzarote in March. Though Matthews has form across all three disciplines, it is her bike-run combination that is her true weapon. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This will be the first IM World Championships for Matthews and she has lofty ambitions of wanting to take the win. This is not at all outlandish though, looking at her track record Matthews has the goods to back this up. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matthews can be expected to exit the water amongst the second pack of swimmers and will want to bridge to the front (and potentially ride away) as quickly as possible. To give Matthews the best chance of victory over Haug, she will be looking for a buffer after the bike given the two being closely matched on the run. With that talent for running, Matthews can be confident that if she comes off the bike with anyone other than Haug, she could comfortably see them off. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>US Hopefuls </b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At the top of the list of strong female contenders who are racing on home soil are </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skye Moench</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jocelyn-mccauley""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jocelyn McCauley</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/heather-jackson""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heather Jackson</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As the top-ranked US athlete on the start line, Skye Moench (PTO World #8) goes into St. George as the favourite among the Americans. This long-distance specialist had a strong and consistent 2021 and came fifth and sixth at 70.3 St. George and the IM 70.3 worlds in St. George respectively last year. That being said in Moench’s final IM of 2021 – Florida – it was Heather Jackson who beat her to the top step. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom:30px } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class=""embed-container""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUWVGbpN4wg?t=138"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In an interview with Triathlon Mockery, Moench said Heather Jackson is one athlete she would like to bark at like a junkyard dog as she passes, so perhaps we’ll see these two fighting it out throughout the race for the top US-finisher accolade.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most recent victory for Heather Jackson (PTO World #13) was that race against Moench at IM Florida at the end of 2021. Having had a difficult season until that point, the result was surely a confidence boost showing training was working – boding well for this race. However, Jackson’s only race to date this year yielded her a DNF at Oceanside. That said, Jackson often rises to the occasion – as shown by her four top-five performances in Kona.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom:30px } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class=""embed-container""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwESiuBXzTc"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Like Ben Hoffman, Jocelyn McCauley (PTO World #15) is coming into St. George having raced and won IM Texas two weeks ago. This certainly shows that McCauley is in great form but the question is whether she’s been able to recover from this effort. Racing a full distance race within two to three weeks of the World Championships is a risky tactic but could it pay dividends for an iron-distance specialist like McCauley?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Other Contenders</b></h3>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lisa-norden""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lisa</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nordén</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #17) hasn’t quite fullfilled the promise of her Olympic-silver winning performance since stepping up to long course, but there’s no doubt she’s one of the strongest cyclists in the sport. A good swimmer, too, Norden could push the pace alongside Ryf on the bike to try and hold off swifter runners.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/fenella-langridge""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fenella Langridge</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #22) impressed on her IM debut last year, coming second at Coeur d’Alene and third in Roth. Her first world champs, this great swimmer might just share the limelight with Haley Chura at the front of the race. She’s got the bike chops too so could feature well towards the finish line.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ruth-astle""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ruth Astle</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #31) took two Ironman titles late last year, clinching victories in Mallorca and South Africa. Her strong bike legs could play a role in St. George leading a chasing pack to cut swim deficits but she’ll need a much improved run to factor in the overall – the question is whether the Brit has made those gains over winter.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/joanna-ryter""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joanna Ryter</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #43) might not be the biggest Swiss name in the women’s field, but she’s one to watch. After four top-five Ironman finishes last season, Ryter came third in Texas a fortnight ago. Her 94% run ranking tells you all you need to know – look out for her making up places on the marathon.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At PTO World #73, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/maja-stage-nielsen""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Maja Stage Nielsen</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s palmares don’t match the cream of the crop in St. George, but solid performances in Kona – 12th, 15th and 11th over the last three editions – along with podiums in Lanzarote and Cozumel show she can handle the heat. This was proved recently at Clash Miami, where the Dane took third place. If attrition in St. George is anything like that race, Stage Nielsen could be the one to profit.</span></p>

To the winners, the Collins Cup trophy and the next chapter in Collins Cup history. To the losers, the Broken Spokes trophy – a year-long motivator to fight back harder next year.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But outside of this Superbowl of triathlon for the professionals, there’s a whole host of other races and activities to satisfy your appetite for triathlon racing and fandom. <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/PTOEventWelcomeGuide2022.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Check out our welcome guide with an intro from Alistair Brownlee</a> and read on to learn more.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collins Cup Age-Group Race</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First up, there’s the Collins Cup age group race: held over 100km, it’ll challenge you to redefine your limits of speed and endurance. Hold strong form over the 2km swim, eke out bigger watts during 80km bike then straddle that redline to beast the 18km run. You can also race as a relay if you want to focus on one or two of the disciplines along with friends or family.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We’ve made the entry fees as affordable as possible with no additional Active fees while our <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/collins-cup/#qodef-tab-c93fcd4"">industry-leading refund policy</a> is in place to allay fears of possible cancellation or potential non-attendance due to covid, injury or even pregnancy. <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/collins-cup/"">Learn more and enter on our Collins Cup race page</a>.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">World Triathlon &amp; Aquathlon Championships</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re in the hunt to don your national colours, the Collins Cup is also the place to race… and not just in triathlon either. Working in partnership with <a href=""https://triathlon.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">World Triathlon</a>, the sport’s global governing body, the Collins Cup will host the 2022 World Triathlon Long Distance World Championship. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Held over the same distance at the open Collins Cup age-group race, this event will give you the chance to earn an age-group world championship title alongside the elite, under-23 and junior divisions. There’s also the World Triathlon Aquabike Championship (2km swim, 80km bike) and the World Triathlon Aquathlon Championship – an opportunity for swim-run specialists to strut their skillset over a 1km swim, 5km run format.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Entry to these World Triathlon events is via your national triathlon governing body only, so if you’re interested in racing get in touch with them directly to state your interest, check qualification criteria and see if you’re eligible.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re coming to watch the pro race rather than take on 100km yourself, but feel inspired to get your heart beating, there will also be a Fun Run. This relaxed 5km dash will help you get into the spirit of competition – and burn the calories required to take full advantage of all the delicious food on offer.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’ll also have the chance to learn directly from PTO professionals thanks to our PTO Tri Talks, where you’ll get insider tips and tricks from the top to give your own swim, bike and run a boost.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The World Triathlon Parade of Nations offers a chance to celebrate your home country in an Olympics-style flag-flying march and is followed by the pasta party, which will give you time to meet like-minded triathlon enthusiasts and swap stories of your biggest victories and challenges in an atmosphere buzzing with pre-race excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meanwhile, the PTO Tour Fan Zone is sure to tempt you with the latest gear, nutrition and tech from the world of triathlon. There will be plenty for both athletes and supporters including a Kids’ Zone, food trucks offering a variety of deliciousness and other surprises you’ll have to wait to see.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On Saturday night, we’ll have a special Champions Concert from Emma Drobna, Slovakia’s leading pop star, to celebrate the Collins Cup victors in style.

<p>From short to long-course, there are few accolades that Spirig does not have to her name. Olympic gold from the 2012 London Olympic Games – where she beat <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lisa-norden"">Lisa Nordén</a> in a historic sprint finish – is one of those absolutely stand out achievements.</p>
<p>Spirig also secured Olympic silver at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games in a throwdown run battle with Gwen Jorgensen. That was on her way to another Olympic appearance in Toyko, giving her an astonishing record of representing Switzerland at the Olympic Games an incredible five times over the course of 17 years!</p>

<p>Since transitioning to long-course racing Spirig has been equally as impressive, using her dominating bike and run to great effect. In the 11 long-course races she has taken part in, Spirig has finished on the podium every single time. Whatsmore, in 2021 Spirig won every long course race she lined up for.</p>
<p>This leads us to 2022, which is to be Spirig’s final year racing as a professional and has saved perhaps the biggest challenge for last! Spirig is one of the two female athletes who will be taking on the Pho3nix Sub 7/8 Project where athletes will attempt to break eight hours for the women and seven hours for the men over the full (ironman) distance. Athletes will have tools at their disposal not typically allowed in competition, with the event set to be an ‘Ineos 1:59’ style show of human endeavour.</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom:30px } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>

<p>Spirig is confident that she will be able to break the ambitious target despite a recent injury setback. We join tri fans around the world in feverish anticipation and cannot wait to see her exhibit her triathlon prowess on this incredible stage before signing off on her professional career, which will come to a close with some events in a ‘farewell tour’ of sorts.</p>
<p>Finally, it cannot be overlooked that Spirig has achieved these great heights in triathlon alongside becoming a mother to three children. All mothers will know the momentous challenge of returning to fitness following pregnancy, indeed it’s a situation that would end careers in many professional sports. But each time, Spirig has come back to triathlon at the top of her game and inspired triathlete mothers everywhere to do the same.</p>
<p>This, along with her many years of promoting children’s physical activity, only highlights to an even greater degree the scale of her achievements and the legacy of her epic career.</p>
<p>That just leaves us to say congratulations on an incredible career Nicola! Good luck for your ambitious goals for the year ahead – and enjoy your retirement!</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then everything boiled over! Within the final 500m, Von Berg passed a significantly slowing Brownlee, Sanders doing the same moments later before powering up to Von Berg’s shoulder. It was on! An all out sprint finish for second place saw both athletes refusing to give an inch and in the end, that’s what it came down to – a dead heat that could only be decided by photo finish. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sprint pace spiked at an eye watering 2:12 min/km as these monster athletes barrelled towards the line! Perhaps a repeat performance will be on the cards this August if both Sanders and Von Berg are pitted against one another at the Collins Cup.</span></p>

<p>Baptista <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CcDAlhtI5es/?utm_medium=copy_link"" rel=""noopener"">recapped her Oceanside race for us on Instagram</a> which you can watch above. Brazilian Baptista found real benefit from the beach start given her swimming prowess and once it came to the bike she thought she’d roll the dice and try something different to maximise her podium chances.</p>
<p>This awesome performance will see the Brazilian take another jump up the rankings and also put her in the ballpark for Team International Collins Cup selection.</p>

The California-based Brit was fourth over the swim and bike legs then rounded out the podium fighting through painful blisters on the run, having opted not to wear socks to save her valuable time in transition. </span></p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ironman South Africa</span></h2>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">South African Men Sweep The Podium</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first full distance race of the season certainly did not disappoint with the racing action that unfolded. A swim shortened to 700m due to rough sea conditions saw the men and women through T1 and onto their bikes in well under 15 minutes. The challenges of the cold, wind and rain more than made up for the shortened swim. Making the podium would be down to not just which athletes boasted the strongest muscular endurance but those who could deal best with the conditions.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/joe-skipper""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joe Skipper</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the men’s favourite going into the race, experienced a small mechanical issue during the bike leg that cost him some time. However, Skipper overcame this setback to ride the fastest bike split of the day and start the run in the leading group. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skipper was not able to maintain the pace of the South African trio of </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/kyle-buckingham""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kyle Buckingham</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/bradley-weiss""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bradley Weiss</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/matt-trautman""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matt Trautman</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and dropped back to fourth. But was it over exertion after his mechanical on the bike or thoughts of saving himself for St George World Championships in a month’s time that saw him post ‘only’ a 2:45 marathon?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">South Africa didn’t provide quite the same explosive finish as the Sanders/Von Berg sprint-off in Oceanside the day before but winner Kyle Buckingham and second place Bradley Weiss were separated by only 19 seconds. Weiss had geen gaining on Buckingham in the final kilometres and had his countryman in sight but Buckingham was able to force every remaining ounce of remaining speed from his body to take his first win since 2018. Keep this form up and Buckingham and Trautman could threaten to break into Team International. </span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bleymehl is Back</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Out of the swim in third and having rode away with a bike split nine minutes faster than the competition, Bleymehl’s closest competitors as the women started the run were World Triathlon Long Distance World Champion </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/sarissa-de-vries""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sarissa De Vries</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/susie-cheetham""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Susie Cheetham</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. After strong starts in the marathon both De Vries and Cheetham unfortunately faded and eventually retired while Bleymehl stayed strong to take victory.</span></p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenge Salou</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenge Salou’s swim, like South Africa, could not go ahead as planned but in this case the entire first leg of this Spanish event had to be cancelled for safety reasons. That left a 4km run, 90km bike and 21.1km run to contest in duathlon format.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Langridge Bags Early Season Win</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the women’s race after the fast and furious run in place of the swim, the trio of </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/lisa-norden""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lisa Nordén</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/fenella-langridge""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fenella Langridge</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/els-visser""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Els Visser</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> established themselves as the front runners on the bike.

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hogenhaug Runs To Victory</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the men’s race it was an equally, if not more, chaotic start with 57 male athletes jostling for the lead over the 4km run. With little to split them by T1, things were just as frenetic on the bike with everyone aiming for the front and no-one wanting to be caught out, meaning lots of surges putting athletes under pressure. </span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/kristian-hogenhaug""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kristian Hogenhaug</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> showed strong form, clocking the second fastest bike split – </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/robert-kallin""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Robert Kallin</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> outdid him by just 13 seconds.

<h3>Men’s Race – Brownlee Is Back!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Top Ranked athletes:</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lionel Sanders</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO #3)<br />

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oceanside has seen many epic battles over the years – including an awesome showdown between Lionel Sanders and </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-frodeno""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jan Frodeno</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in 2018 – but one athlete who’s never raced in this stacked-field season opener is double Olympic champ, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/alistair-brownlee""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alistair Brownlee</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s set to change on Saturday though. After his absence in the second half of 2021 following his attempts to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and a long recovery from ankle surgery, two-time Olympic Champion Ali Brownlee is back!</span></p>

<p><script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brownlee will face none other than Lionel Sanders, whose race against Frodeno here in 2018 lit a fire within Sanders that still burns strong to this day. Sanders comes into the 2022 season confident having executed strong consistent performance at the end of 2021 under the guidance of new coach Mikal Iden (big brother and coach of Gustav Iden). </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brownlee and Sanders have met before on three occasions (</span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/race/challenge-samorin/2017/results""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenge Samorin 2017</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/race/im-hawaii/2019/results""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kona 2019</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and the </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/race/challenge-daytona/2020/results""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">PTO 2020 Championship</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) but on all occasions either one or both did not have strong days so have never had the chance to go toe-to-toe with one another. </span></p>
<div class=""h2h"" style=""font-size: 20px; text-align: center; border: 2px solid #d10b0c; font-weight: 600; padding: 5px 10px; display: block; width: fit-content; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: Avenir Next LT W04 Heavy Cn It,sans-serif; text-transform: uppercase;""><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/head-to-head/alistair-brownlee/lionel-sanders?_ga=2.204361360.1600647043.1648654116-161686127.1646063246"" class=""h2hlink""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Head-to-head: Sanders vs Brownlee</span></a></div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having not seen Brownlee race since his Olympic qualification bid ended in a controversial DQ at WTCS Leeds back in June 2021, it could be reasonable to have a question mark hanging over Brownlee’s form upon return… However, word on the street is that Brownlee is stronger and faster than ever over the middle and long distance!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This would bode well for him in a year where he is also set to go up against Kristian Blummenfelt in the Pho3nix Sub7 Project. While both are aiming to beat the seven-hour mark, they are equally going to be battling to see who can go under seven hours by the biggest margin.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brownlee and Sanders may be the headline names racing in Oceanside but you should never count out the likes of Ben Kanute, Rudy Von Berg, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jackson Laundry</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-appleton""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sam Appleton</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/matt-hanson""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matt Hanson</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and so many more world class athletes all on the start list. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ben Kanute of course has won Oceanside on the previous two runnings of the race in 2021 and 2019 (the 2020 edition was cancelled due to COVID), beating Rudy Von Berg on one of those occasions in 2019 by just 12 seconds! There will certainly be a score to settle there.</span></p>

<h3>Women’s Race – Knibb vs. Ryf Reimagined!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Top-ranked athletes: </span></p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-ryf""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daniela Ryf</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO #3)<br />
</span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/taylor-knibb""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Taylor Knibb</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO #5)<br />
</span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skye Moench</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO #8)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The last (and so far only) time that Daniela Ryf and Taylor Knibb have raced one another was their match at The Collins Cup where Ryf was self-admittedly not on form and “arguably shouldn’t have raced but didn’t want to let the team down”. Knibb took an ‘easy’ match victory and was disappointed that she didn’t get to race Daniela on her best day. Now is Knibb’s chance to take on a refreshed Ryf, who’s back and stronger than ever with a new mindset to training, racing and life in general.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The women’s start list is equally as stacked as the men&#8217;s, meaning that if Ryf or Knibb let slip even just a little, there will be many fierce competitors ready to pounce on them for the win! Skye Moench, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Paula Findlay</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/holly-lawrence""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Holly Lawrence</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/heather-jackson""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heather Jackson</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackie-hering""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jackie Hering</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/tamara-jewett""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tamara Jewett</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chelsea Sodaro</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are all names that could be very much in the mix come Saturday. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t forget to watch out for former short-course athlete </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/ashleigh-gentle""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ashleigh Gentle</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, who’s coming off a big win at Clash Miami. A few more races like that and she’s sure to shoot up the PTO World Rankings and become a shoo-in for the Collins Cup this August.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With such strength in depth, one can only hope that there will be some dramatic racing on show pushing one another to the limit! </span></p>

<h2>Challenge Salou</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For those athletes staying in Europe, this weekend, the big half-distance race is Challenge Salou, which boasts a strong field looking to move up the rankings.</span></p>
<p><b>Date: Sunday 3 April<br />
</b><b>Location: Salou, Spain<br />
</b><b>Local start time: 08:00</b></p>
<h3><strong>Women’s Race – Haug vs Nordén</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Top-ranked Athletes:</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-haug""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Anne Haug</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO #4)<br />

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the women’s race, Challenge Salou will make it two races in two weeks for Anne Haug and after a second-place finish in Lanzarote, behind </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/katrina-matthews""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kat Matthews</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> who scored an impressive 104.92 points, Haug will be eager to go one better and be standing on top of the podium. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It will be by no means an easy win for Haug – she will have to overcome the likes of Lisa Nordén who won Challenge Salou in 2021. Nordén has recently been training with </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Laura Philipp</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, who just became PTO World #1, so perhaps Nordén will be in equally strong form and be able to make it two-second place finishes for Haug in two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The long list of other female challengers is topped by Fenella Langridge. The Brit will be taking her brand new Trek Speed Concept out for its first race, having been flaunting the wind tunnel testing she’s been doing on Instagram, so let’s see how slick she is on course! Then there’s </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-zimmermann""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Laura Zimmerman</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/justine-mathieux""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Justine Mathieux</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/elisabetta-curridori""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Elisabetta Curridori</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/india-lee""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">India Lee</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">… the list goes on! </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Short course superstar </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/vincent-luis""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vincent Luis</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is set to further build his middle-distance resumé with Salou being only his third middle distance race. Luis’s previous middle distances exploits include a second-place finish at 70.3 Indian Wells in 2021 behind Lionel Sanders – an incredible result given that he was knocked off his bike by a car after being sent off course. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Luis also finished eighth at the PTO 2020 Championship having received a two-minute penalty for drafting on the bike. That made his final gap to winner </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gustav Iden</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, 2 minutes and 15 seconds. Perhaps we’ll get to see that sprint finish later in the season!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Luis will be lining up alongside Miki Moerck Taagholt, Kristian Høgenhaug, Denis Chevrot, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-laidlow""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sam Laidlow</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/clement-mignon""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Clement Mignon</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Like the women’s race there is a long list of other challengers racing in Salou, all hungry to bank a strong result early in the season.</span></p>

<h2>Ironman South Africa</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Full distance racing is back! While there have already been a handful of middle distance races for pros to tick off, this is the first opportunity for those full distance specialists to flex – and the chance to walk away with the African Championship title.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Men’s Race – Skipper Starts The Season, Chartier Steps Up</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Top-ranked Athletes:</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/joe-skipper""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joe Skipper</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO #7)<br />

</span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jesper-svensson""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jesper Svensson</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO #36)</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Favouring the full-distance, it’s no surprise that Joe Skipper has journeyed to South Africa to race and is the hands-down favourite to take the win. </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/justin-metzler""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Justin Metzler</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> teased Skipper during the Collins Cup press conference for only having “one speed” and not being able to match him and Jackson Laundry over the 100km distance… That one speed however is RAPID over the full distance. Finishing off 2021 with a 100 point score at </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/race/im-chattanooga/2021/results""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">IM Chattanooga</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Skipper has been banking consistent miles over the offseason so can expect a strong start from the Brit.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Other notable mentions include Collin Chartier, taking on his first-ever full-distance race. Though they did not race in the same match at the Collins Cup, Skipper’s overall finish time was two minutes faster than Chartier so if it did come down to a sprint to the finish between the two, one might expect Skipper to be able to pull out some speed over the American… </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Home favourites </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/bradley-weiss""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bradley Weiss</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/matt-trautman""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matt Trautman</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> will certainly be gunning to take the title of first South African across the line and will also be keen to get in the mix at the front of the race. Also, Jesper Svensson will be racing to overwrite his DNF at the race in 2021 and having clocked the fastest swim in 2021, he’ll no doubt be hoping to enter T1 in first and hold on for as long as he can!</span></p>

<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-bleymehl""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daniela Bleymehl</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> had a disappointing return to racing in Dubai earlier this year with a DNF, both her first 2022 race but also her first race since returning from maternity leave. Bleymehl has multiple 100+ point scores in her race record prior to maternity leave so it surely is only a matter of time before she’s back on top.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bleymehl will have the likes of Sarissa De Vries, winner of the World Long Distance Triathlon Championship in 2021, to contend with, as well as Emma Bilham, another strong competitor over the full distance. Kylie Simpson is also expected to be in the mix and with two 80+ point scores and one 34 point score contributing to her ranking of 55th this will surely be a chance to make a big leap in the rankings with a good result. </span></p>

<h2>Men’s Race</h2>
<p>2019 70.3 world champ and PTO 2020 Champion Gustav Iden is a strong favourite at the race. He can swim well, bike with the best and then outrun them – as evidenced by his fastest run split at the Collins Cup. If anyone’s going to take Iden down, the Norwegian will make them work for it.</p>
<p>Sam Long came second to Lionel Sanders at 70.3 St. George in May and while this course is a little different, it suits his strong bike-run combo. The question is, will the front of the race be too far out of reach after the swim for him to get to use his strength?</p>
<p>Daniel Baekkegard is a big challenger for the title. Imperious in his match-up at the Collins Cup, where he had the day’s third-fastest time, the Dane has no weaknesses and should be vying for the lead from the gun in St. George. A head-to-head with the Norwegians could provide a real battle to the line.</p>
<p>Tokyo Olympic Champion <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/kristian-blummenfelt""> Kristian Blummenfelt</a> could well be Iden’s biggest rival and following his World Triathlon title, is clearly in scintillating form. The pair have only fought it out at two 70.3 events previously: 70.3 Bahrain in 2019 – where Blummenfelt put Iden into second with the world-record time; and the 2019 world champs in Nice – where Blummenfelt came fourth. St. George’s hilly bike and run could favour Iden, but don’t be surprised to see two Norwegians on the podium.</p>
<p>While Long is ranked higher, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-kanute"">Ben Kanute</a> (PTO #11) has the all-round swim, bike and run speed that could see him finish as the best US athlete at the event. He had the fourth-fastest time at the Collins Cup behind Frodeno, Iden and Baekkegard, so is in great form but suffered in St. George in May only coming 26th.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/george-goodwin"">George Goodwin</a> (PTO #13) missed out on Collins Cup selection so will be all-in for 70.3 worlds. After taking third at the PTO 2020 champs in Daytona last December, the Brit showed his class to take the 70.3 European title in June. However, like Kanute, he had a substandard race in St. George this May with a 17th place finish.</p>
<h2>Look Out For</h2>
<p>All-star swimmer and fifth-fastest finisher at the Collins Cup, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-appleton"">Sam Appleton</a> (PTO #15) should be right up there.</p>
<p>The pedigree of nine-time world champ <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/javier-gomez""> Javier Gomez</a> (PTO #16) is always worth taking notice of.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/florian-angert"">Florian Angert</a> (PTO #23) is a swim-bike beast and just won Challenge Samorin.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry"">Jackson Laundry</a> (PTO #26) had the fourth-fastest run at the Collins Cup and that form could see him finish strong here too.</p>
<h2>Women’s Race</h2>
<p>Daniela Ryf bounced back after illness at the Collins Cup to win IM Switzerland on 5 September, but that effort is unlikely to dent her power here. Never too far behind in the swim, the Swiss star is peerless on the bike, creating insurmountable leads on her opponents. Because of that, we’ve not seen her pushed in a run battle but given Ryf’s already got five 70.3 world titles in the bag, it would be foolish to bet against her. She also won 70.3 St. George in May, so we know she races well over this terrain.</p>
<p>As in years past in Kona, Lucy Charles-Barclay could be Ryf’s biggest threat in St. George. Despite being ill at the Collins Cup, the 70.3 European champ put in the second-fastest time of the day. She’s bound to have a lead out the swim and if she can hold Ryf when the pass we’re all expecting happens, it’ll be a great running duel to the finish.</p>
<p>Holly Lawrence came second to Charles-Barclay at the 70.3 Euro champs but that was a week after winning 70.3 Des Moines stateside. A true all-rounder, Lawrence came closest to Ryf at the 2019 worlds on a course that didn’t suit her. Lawrence took sixth at 70.3 St. George in May but expect her to finish higher this weekend.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/emma-pallant"">Emma Pallant-Browne</a> (PTO #7) is a real star on the rise. Now coached by Tim Don, the South Africa-based Brit came third at St. George in May despite some gastro issues before coming second to Lawrence in Des Moines. Her recent form is exceptional with first at 70.3 Boulder, besting Lawrence at Escape From Alcatraz and setting the third-fastest time at the Collins Cup. With an improved swim, this uber-bike-runner could top the podium on Saturday.</p>
<p>She might be way down the PTO rankings, but <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/taylor-knibb""> Taylor Knibb</a> will be up at the top of many people’s lists for a win in St. George. The American, who took mixed relay silver in Tokyo, had the fastest split at the Collins Cup including the swiftest bike leg despite riding a road bike. A faster swimmer than Ryf, we could see Knibb working with Charles-Barclay on the bike then sticking with Ryf on the bike and running away to victory.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jeanni-metzler"">Jeanni Metzler</a> (PTO #11) took second behind Ryf at 70.3 St. George in May with a superb run that put her within five minutes of the champ. The hilly course suits her and she races well in the heat, so a podium certainly isn’t out of the question for the South African.</p>
<p>After beating Metzler and Anne Haug at the Collins Cup with the day’s fastest run, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackie-hering"">Jackie Hering</a> (PTO #15) won’t be flying under the radar this weekend. If she can limit her losses on the swim and hang tough on the bike, Hering is sure to improve on her eighth place from the race in May.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/ellie-salthouse"">Ellie Salthouse</a> (PTO #16) is another athlete who wouldn’t be out of place on the podium. The Aussie star has five middle-distance wins this season plus a win in her Collins Cup matchup. She’s a 70.3 specialist and a strong all-rounder who’s great in the heat so expect a strong performance.</p>
<p>When she’s on, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay"">Paula Findlay</a> (PTO #6) has the talent and speed to crush it. The PTO 2020 Champion has had a strong rather than stunning 2021 but came fourth at 70.3 St. George in May before being sidelined by injury. She wasn’t back to her best for the Collins Cup but if she’s on her game this weekend, the podium beckons.</p>
<h2>Look Out For</h2>
<p>Despite being more of an iron-distance specialist, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/katrina-matthews"">Kat Matthews</a> (PTO #9) had the fourth-fastest time at the Collins Cup.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench"">Skye Moench</a> (PTO #10) will be toeing the line in her first 70.3 Worlds as was the top US-finisher at St. George in May with fifth place.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/imogen-simmonds"">Imogen Simmonds</a> (PTO #20) was second to Ryf at 70.3 Dubai and has the class to finish well here too.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro"">Chelsea Sodaro</a> (PTO #22) is proving herself a super-mom and just keeps getting stronger on her path back to the top after giving birth in March.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/tamara-jewett"">Tamara Jewett</a> (PTO #65) recently won Timberman with a 1:14:19 half marathon split – the third-fastest ever in a middle-distance race.</p>

<h2 class=""p1"">Women’s Matches</h2>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #1</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-ryf""><span class=""s1"">Daniela Ryf</span></a> (PTO #1)<span class=""Apple-converted-space""><br />
</span><span class=""s2"">Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/taylor-knibb""><span class=""s1"">Taylor Knibb</span></a><br />
</span>Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/teresa-adam""><span class=""s1"">Teresa Adam</span></a> (PTO #2)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe Captains Natascha Badmann and Normann Stadler went hard out the gate by picking Daniela Ryf for the first-ever Collins Cup matchup. Ryf is, without doubt, one of the sport’s greats – a strong swimmer, an unbelievably powerful cyclist and a sensational runner.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Internationals Captains Lisa Bentley and Simon Whitfield matched the world #1 with the world #2 – Teresa Adam. Adam is an athlete who could put time into Ryf during the swim and one of the only athletes in the sport with a chance of matching the Swiss Miss on the bike. While the Kiwi’s run stats fall short of Ryf’s, Adam’s not raced since January – and never before in Europe – so her running form could surprise on Saturday.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In Taylor Knibb, Team US Captains Karen Smyers and Mark Allen went straight in for a tactical pick in match #1, pitting the speed of an up-and-coming short-course star against these two proven iron-distance champions. At the recent World Triathlon events in Canada, Knibb – the Collins Cup’s youngest competitor – showed she’s one of the sport’s best swimmers and bikers. Meanwhile, while her 1:21 run split at 70.3 Boulder is faster than Adam has ever produced over the distance. Add in the fact that this battle will be fought over 2km, 80km and 18km and Knibb is a genuine contender for the win.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #2</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lucy-charles-barclay""><span class=""s1"">Lucy Charles-Barclay</span></a> (PTO #4)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/katie-zaferes""><span class=""s1"">Katie Zaferes</span></a><br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay""><span class=""s1"">Paula Findlay</span></a> (PTO #6)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lucy Charles-Barclay has shown herself to be adept at all distances but her tactics are well known to the other teams – use her swimming strength to make a gap, ride hard and try to maintain that buffer for the run. While the Brit might fulfil the first part of that gameplan in the water, her lead to a pair of stellar swimmers in Paula Findlay and double Olympic medallist Katie Zaferes might not be great enough to put her out of sight.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Findlay has beaten Charles-Barclay before, the Canadian running away to take the win at Challenge Daytona in 2019. Findlay’s bike stats also give her the edge on the second discipline so she could wipe out any swim deficit before the matchup is over.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Katie Zaferes is the second wildcard for Team US. While she’s unproven at middle-distance events, the American’s pedigree speaks for itself as a World Triathlon Champion and Tokyo 2020 bronze and silver medallist. An awesome swim, bike, runner with no weaknesses, Zaferes could show the other two what speed really is.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #3</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-haug""><span class=""s1"">Anne Haug</span></a> (PTO #3)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackie-hering""><span class=""s1"">Jackie Hering</span></a> (PTO #15)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jeanni-metzler""><span class=""s1"">Jeanni Metzler</span></a> (PTO #11)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Match #3 will be a battle of the runners. Team Europe’s Anne Haug is widely considered the sport’s best in the third discipline – reflected in a running rating of 100%. That means the only tactic for Team US and Team Internationals will be to put time into the German before the run begins.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Jeanni Metzler is an incredible runner herself, with a fastest half-marathon split of 1:15:26 this season. On paper, the South African should beat both Haug and Hering out the water, too. So, if she can hold an advantage by T2, she could take the win.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Hering shares the same 84% swim rating as Haug, so the two could well hit the bike together. If that’s after Metzler, there could be some tactical plays when it comes to whose job it is to lead the charge.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Metzler has beaten Hering in three of their last four races together – though it was the American who took the most recent scalp. However, Haug thrashed them both at the PTO 2020 Championship at Challenge Daytona.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #4</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/holly-lawrence""><span class=""s1"">Holly Lawrence</span></a> (PTO #5)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench""><span class=""s1"">Skye Moench</span></a> (PTO #10)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/ellie-salthouse""><span class=""s1"">Ellie Salthouse</span></a> (PTO #16)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Holly Lawrence is a seriously tough competitor and a middle-distance specialist who’s highly accomplished in all three disciplines. But that doesn’t mean it’ll be a walkover for Team Europe in match #4.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Lawrence is likely to lead this trio out the water but Ellie Salthouse, who’s also a great swimmer and a middle-distance maestro herself, could stay on the Brit’s toes then force her to work on the bike.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While Moench might lose a bit of time in the swim, she’s the strongest cyclist of the three and beat Lawrence the last time they raced together at 70.3 St George. So unless there’s a significant gap, it could all come back together by T2 – leaving the race to be decided on the run.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">All three athletes are well-matched here but with no love lost between Lawrence and Salthouse, the Aussie – who’s undefeated in 2021 over middle-distance – could have the extra motivation to clinch victory.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #5</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/emma-pallant""><span class=""s1"">Emma Pallant-Browne</span></a> (PTO #7)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro""><span class=""s1"">Chelsea Sodaro</span></a> (PTO #22)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sarah-crowley""><span class=""s1"">Sarah Crowley</span></a> (PTO #13)</p>
<p class=""p1"">On paper, match #5 should be a win for Team Europe. With her overall ranking of 94%, Emma Pallant-Browne’s only slight weakness is in the swim though she still trumps Sodaro and Crowley in that department.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Even if American super-mom, Sodaro, and iron-distance Aussie, Crowley, can stick to the Brit’s feet in the water, it’s unlikely they’ll drop her on the bike – Pallant-Browne has shown she’s a match for anyone but Daniela Ryf on two wheels.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On the run, Pallant-Browne is impeccable, her fastest split a 1:16:54 this season. Could we see the Brit take extra points for a match domination? It could be on the cards.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Either way, the more exciting battle could be for second place between Sodaro, who’s still on the upward swing back to her best after returning from maternity leave, and Crowley, the iron-distance powerhouse whose skillset might not suit this shorter course.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #6</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/kat-matthews""><span class=""s1"">Kat Matthews</span></a> (PTO #9)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jocelyn-mccauley""><span class=""s1"">Jocelyn McCauley</span></a> (PTO #41)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/carrie-lester""><span class=""s1"">Carrie Lester</span></a> (PTO #8)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Match #6 is a battle of long-course warriors. All three women have performed over the iron distance this season – and all broken the nine-hour barrier in the process.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With higher swimming rankings, there’s a chance the McCauley and Lester could edge out Matthews on the swim. Lester would then be hoping to use her bike prowess – she’s rated 96% – to make a gap before the run.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Both Lester and McCauley will need time on Kat Matthews before the run as the Brit has shown she’s an athlete to be feared on the final leg. Matthews ran 2:49:48 for the marathon in May – the fastest time of the last five years. That said, the 18km finale isn’t ideally suited to any of these iron-forged specialists, so there could be an upset by the finish line.</p>
<h2 class=""p1"">Men’s Matches</h2>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #7</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-frodeno""><span class=""s1"">Jan Frodeno</span></a> (PTO #1)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-long""><span class=""s1"">Sam Long</span></a> (PTO #4)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-appleton""><span class=""s1"">Sam Appleton</span></a> (PTO #15)</p>
<p class=""p1"">With the world #1 ranking, the iron-distance world record and a winning streak that goes back to the start of the 2018 season, everyone is expecting Jan Frodeno to perform at the Collins Cup. That puts a huge target on his back and gives both the German’s competitors extra incentive to be the one to topple the champ.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A superb swimmer, Sam Appleton should be out the water with Frodeno but will need to pull out something special on the bike as Frodeno’s 99% run rating is significantly higher than his own 85%. Perhaps the safe bet will be to shadow Frodeno for as long as possible and try to score maximum points over Sam Long – then again, where’s the fun in that?</p>
<p class=""p1"">At just 25, Long has rocketed to the top of the sport with a massive bike-run combo and the personality to match. The Big Unit will be desperate to beat Frodo and while his bike is ranked higher – 99% versus 94% – the American might just lose too much time in the swim to make it count. One thing’s for sure though, Long won’t let up for a second in the chase – recently coming from behind to beat Appleton in Boulder, which is sure to give him a psychological edge.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #8</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden""><span class=""s1"">Gustav Iden</span></a> (PTO #3)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/rudy-von-berg""><span class=""s1"">Rudy Von Berg</span></a> (PTO #8)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/kyle-smith""><span class=""s1"">Kyle Smith</span></a> (PTO #27)</p>
<p class=""p1"">As PTO 2020 Champion and reigning 70.3 world champ, Norway’s Gustav Iden is the real deal. An athlete who gets stronger as the race progresses through the disciplines, it’s Iden’s run that earned him both titles – beating Rudy Von Berg on both occasions.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Von Berg will be seeking to distance Iden in the swim and with a similar pace through the water as Kyle Smith, the pair could work well over the 2km to put a little time into Iden. Von Berg is higher-ranked on the bike than Smith but the Kiwi is no slouch having ridden sub-two-hours in a half this year.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The pair will need quite a buffer to stave off the Norwegian’s inexorable run speed, but there’s a chance Iden could simply run out of road to make the catch.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While Smith appears the underdog of the match-up, he definitely shouldn’t be counted out for the win. The New Zealander had the fastest swim and bike times at the 70.3 European champs in June and with a shorter run, this could be the perfect distance for him.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #9</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sebastian-kienle""><span class=""s1"">Sebastian Kienle</span></a> (PTO #19)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/andrew-starykowicz""><span class=""s1"">Andrew Starykowicz</span></a> (PTO #33)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders""><span class=""s1"">Lionel Sanders</span></a> (PTO #2)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sebastian Kienle’s form coming into the Collins Cup is a complete unknown. He’s been rehabbing injuries and hasn’t raced since May. If he’s back to his best, the German’s a true warrior who will stop at nothing – this is a man who rode an entire 180km bike leg with a piece of glass digging into his foot.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lionel Sanders wanted the match-up against Sebastian Kienle, who he’s battled with twice before at Challenge Samorin and come out on top both times. The pair are similarly matched in the swim but Sanders should have the edge on the bike and run. However, he’s just a week post a big iron-distance race in Copenhagen so whether he’s firing on all cylinders could make the difference here.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While Sanders is ranked 100% on the bike, Starykowicz – who’s ranked 99% – has a long reputation as the sport’s most dominant cyclist. A late call-up for the Collins Cup, Starykowicz is also a better swimmer than both Kienle and Sanders, so should be off up the road before that pairing leaves the water. Realistically, though, he’ll need at least five minutes in hand to have a chance at victory, which could be just too much in a race this length.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #10</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniel-baekkegard""><span class=""s1"">Daniel Baekkegard</span></a> (PTO #10)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-kanute""><span class=""s1"">Ben Kanute</span></a> (PTO #11)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/max-neumann""><span class=""s1"">Max Neumann</span></a> (PTO #17)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Based on the rankings, this is one of the closest Collins Cup matchups we’ll get to see on Saturday. Daniel Baekkegard, Ben Kanute and Max Neumann are all spectacular swimmers and will surely stay together in the water. They’re also bike and run powerhouses, all ranked within a couple of percent of each other.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Baekkegard is an athlete everyone’s been talking about – his win at 70.3 Bahrain this year was the third-fastest ever over the distance, probably making him the one to beat here.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kanute, meanwhile, has shown he can maintain his short-course speed alongside his middle-distance focus. If anything, this slightly shorter bike and run distance only favours the American, who recently took his fourth straight victory at Escape From Alcatraz, an iconic standard-distance race.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Neumann is the least known of the three but is a double IM Asia Pacific Champion. Don’t let those iron-distance wins fool you though, the Aussie is a seriously fast athlete who’s run 1:10 this season.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">All in all, this one’s too close to call.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #11</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/patrick-lange""><span class=""s1"">Patrick Lange</span></a> (PTO #7)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/matt-hanson""><span class=""s1"">Matt Hanson</span></a> (PTO #9)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/braden-currie""><span class=""s1"">Braden Currie</span></a> (PTO #6)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Braden Currie is an incredibly consistent performer. He’s not had the chance to race outside his native New Zealand over the last two years, so will be desperate to test himself against this tough competition. The strongest swimmer in the match and equal to the others on the bike, his run ranking is also just 1% lower than Patrick Lange’s at 96%.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A two-time Kona winner, Lange is arguably the world’s best iron-distance runner. However, while the German excels over the longer races, his middle-distance palmares aren’t quite of the same calibre, his last win coming in 2017.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lange’s improved swim-bike could be crucial in the match, especially if he can stick behind Braden Currie in the water to distance Matt Hanson. If the pair reaches T2 with an advantage, we should be in for an exciting shoulder-to-shoulder run.</p>
<p class=""p1"">However, with a 100% run rating, Matt Hanson could have the speed to close down anything but a colossal lead. Throughout 2021, the American has proven himself the best middle-distance runner in the world, seemingly constantly surging through the field to put in race-best splits. If Hanson reaches T2 with the others, Team US could score top points here.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #12</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/joe-skipper""><span class=""s1"">Joe Skipper</span></a> (PTO #5)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/justin-metzler""><span class=""s1"">Justin Metzler</span></a> (PTO #54)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry""><span class=""s1"">Jackson Laundry</span></a> (PTO #26)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Team US Captains’ Pick, Justin Metzler, was brought onto the team on the back of his great second-place at IM Coeur d’Alene and fifth-place at 70.3 Boulder recently. Metzler’s ace card here is his swim, where he could distance both his competitors and solo away to build a lead.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Jackson Laundry comes to the Collins Cup in rising form after going third, second and first in his last three races. If he’s within hailing distance of Metzler after T1, the pair could work well together on the bike to keep Skipper at bay. Metzler and Laundry are ranked at 89 and 90% on the run so we should see a good battle between the two.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Joe Skipper is one of the fastest bike-runners in the business with a 96% bike rating and 100% run rating – credentials he’s often underlined at iron-distance races. At the middle distance, he’s less consistent and has yet to put a win against his scorecard. There’s no doubting his talent though, he could yet pull something out the bag – if he can overturn what’s likely to be a significant swim deficit.</p>
<h2 class=""p1"">History In The Making</h2>
<p class=""p1"">With such an array of talented and well-matched athletes going head-to-head in this totally new race format, triathlon history will be made on Saturday. Not only is the team dynamic new to long-course triathlon but with Team Captains able to help shape race outcomes through radio communications and access to athlete data, it’ll be a fascinating new take on what the sport of swim, bike and run can be.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The race coverage gets underway at 12:30 CEST on Saturday but there’s plenty more to watch on the <a href=""https://thecollinscup.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/""><span class=""s1"">Collins Cup website</span></a> or iOS/Android app before then including both parts of the PTO’s Beyond Human documentary and the Battle For Glory and Greater Than One video series.</p>

<p class=""p1"">The Collins Cup is coming up this Saturday and as the excitement ratchets ever higher, you can get even closer to the action with the <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/fantasy""><span class=""s1"">Collins Cup Fantasy Competition</span></a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">After the fun of the Tokyo tri fantasy game, which featured over 1,300 participants, the stakes are higher this time around. While the Collins Cup Fantasy Competition is completely free to play there’s a Grand Prize of an all-expenses-paid trip for two to the 2022 Collins Cup on the line – the trip of a lifetime for any triathlon fan.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Meanwhile, second-and third-place finishers will bag a TAG Heuer connected watch. There are also plenty of prizes to be won courtesy of Wahoo, the event’s Official Transition Partner, including a Wahoo KICKR Bike for fourth place, Wahoo KICKR Smart Trainers for fifth and sixth place and Wahoo ELEMNT RIVAL multisport watches for seventh to 10th place.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If that whets your appetite to give it a go, read on for how to get started with the Collins Cup Fantasy Competition.</p>
<h2>Collins Cup Fantasy Competition – How To Play</h2>
<p class=""p1"">The Collins Cup Fantasy Competition gets underway immediately after the Collins Cup opening ceremony on Wednesday 25 August. It’s here we’ll get to find out which athletes will be pitted against one another in all 12 of the race matchups – as well as getting a chance to see all the stars resplendent in their new race kit.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Once those all-important matchups have been decided in the Captain’s Match Draft Draw, the game is afoot! All you need to do is pick who you think will finish first, second and third in every matchup.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">First place athletes are worth 300 points, second 200 points and third 100 points. There are also bonus points for the first two athletes across the line based on the time gap to their competitors.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For each correct guess, you’ll be awarded that athlete’s points. So, if you correctly predict a trifecta the points will really rack up in your favour! The more points you have at the end of the day, the higher you’ll be ranked – but can you make it into the top 10 to earn a prize?</p>
<p class=""p1"">Like the previous tri fantasy games, success at the Collins Cup Fantasy Competition will take all your athlete knowledge and a big slice of luck. While we can’t help with the latter, now is the time to brush up on everything you need to know about all the Collins Cup athletes through our <a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/""><span class=""s1"">PTO Stats site</span></a>.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">You’ll find a treasure trove of historical data and recent results as well as being able to view how athletes have fared against one another in the past using the Head-To-Head feature. So, jump in and take a deep dive into the stats to perfect your predictions.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Collins Cup coverage gets underway at 12:30 CEST on Saturday. You can catch every second through live broadcasts in over 100 countries as well as on the Collins Cup website or the newly launched Collins Cup iOS/Android app. Head over to the <a href=""https://thecollinscup.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/broadcast-information/""><span class=""s1"">Collins Cup broadcast information page</span></a> to find out where to watch in your region.</p>

Here’s who’s racing on 28 August.</p>
<p>With the likes of Lionel Sanders and Paula Findlay, Team Internationals have some of the world’s best – and best-known – triathletes. But they’ve also got the advantage of others who’ve flown under the radar during the pandemic who will be ready to strike at the Collins Cup.</p>
<p>A surfeit of quality athletes from which to choose has meant the Captains Picks have only added to the strength in depth for Team Internationals. Meanwhile, the Team Captains themselves – Lisa Bentley and Simon Whitfield – lend the team both long- and short-course tactical expertise.</p>

</ol>
<p>Teresa Adam has been hunkered in New Zealand during Covid but has still put in some incredible performances throughout the Collins Cup qualification period. The Kiwi scored big points at three IM races over 2019 and 2020 and the Port of Tauranga Half this year. A great swimmer and superb biker, her run is the unknown for her competitors.</p>
<p>Paula Findlay made a big name for herself by winning the PTO 2020 Championships at Challenge Daytona last December. The Canadian followed that up with seventh at Challenge Miami and a gutsy never-say-die performance for fourth at 70.3 St. George. She’s just come good after a running injury but if she’s back to her best, she’s one of the strongest all-rounders in the business.</p>
<p>Carrie Lester secured her Collins Cup place thanks to three Ironman wins in 2019 and a sensationally fast sub-nine victory at IM Coeur d’Alene in June. The Aussie is a great swimmer and runner but a real powerhouse on the bike, which is sure to feature in the tactics of the Team Captains.</p>
<p>South Africa’s Jeanni Metzler has had a fantastic 2021 season, seeking out races against the best and coming away with second at 70.3 Texas and St. George and third at 70.3 Boulder. Each time she’s unleashed a ferocious run pace that’ll worry any of her potential matchups at the Collins Cup.</p>
<p>Sarah Crowley has twice finished third in Kona and was also the 2017 World Triathlon Long Distance champion, underlining her credentials to race with aplomb when it really counts. By her exceptionally high standards, Crowley didn’t shine quite as brightly at the start of 2021. However, first at 70.3 Ecuador in July signalled the Australian is on the way back to her best and was enough for her to gain a Captains Pick slot.</p>
<p>Ellie Salthouse comes into the Collins Cup unbeaten in 2021 over six middle-distance races including 70.3 Geelong and, most recently, 70.3 Andorra. The team’s third Aussie is certainly one of the form athletes of the season and given the Collins Cup’s 2km swim, 80km bike and 18km run format, she could well be the strongest of the women’s competitors.</p>
<h2>Team Internationals Men</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders"">Lionel Sanders</a> (PTO #2)</li>
<li><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/braden-currie"">Braden Currie</a> (PTO #6)</li>

<li><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry"">Jackson Laundry</a> (PTO #26)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Team Internationals men are headed by Lionel Sanders. Undoubtedly one of the world’s best 70.3 athletes and a true fighter, Sanders has a second at Challenge Miami and wins at 70.3 Texas and St. George this season – both against highly competitive fields. He also set a new iron-distance PB at the Tri Battle Royale and backed that up with second at IM Copenhagen last weekend. A middle-distance ace, while he might lose time in the swim, he’s got the bike-run to have the others running scared. Plus, he’s won twice in Samorin previously at Challenge The Championship.</p>
<p>Winner of his native IM New Zealand this year, Braden Currie is a supremely consistent athlete who’s truly talented across all three disciplines. Outside of his top-10 showings at the 70.3 worlds and Kona, he’s not finished off the podium since late 2017. While he’s yet to face an international field in 2021, he’s got the full swim-bike-run package to go toe-to-toe with the best the other teams can muster.</p>
<p>Sam Appleton is a middle-distance specialist with a stacked resume of 15 wins and 25 podiums. Sixth at the PTO 2020 Championships last December, this swim-bike monster races from the front but also has the goods on the run to close it out for the win. His second at 70.3 Boulder recently shows he’s in great form and the Collins Cup format should suit his swimming strengths.</p>
<p>Max Neumann goes into the Collins Cup after wins at Challenge Shepparton and IM Cairns this year, successfully defending his title from 2020 at the latter. Another of the young no-weaknesses breed, the Australian has it where it counts in each discipline but is an incredible swimmer who’s likely to make time on his competitors. The biggest question mark is that he’s not raced outside of Australia over the last two years, so we’ll have to wait to see if that’s to his advantage or disadvantage come the matchup.</p>
<p>The first Captains Pick athlete for Team Internationals is rising 70.3 star, Kyle Smith. The 23-year-old Kiwi won his first five middle-distance events before showing serious grit to take third at his first full at IM New Zealand in March. Another sensational swimmer, Smith led from the water at the 70.3 Euro champs in Elsinore where he also had the fastest bike split before fading towards the end of the run to fifth. With that swim-bike strength and a shorter 18km run at the Collins Cup, he could well solo to victory.</p>
<p>Jackson Laundry has made his desire to represent Team Internationals clear over the qualifying period but it’s his rising form in 2021 that surely caught the Captains’ eyes. The Canadian took third at 70.3 Des Moines, second at Rev3 Williamsburg and first at 70.3 Ecuador. He might not match the very fastest for swim speed but his quality bike-run package makes him a strong pick.</p>
<p>With some of the world’s classiest athletes and a diverse range of swim, bike and run strength, Team Internationals have the talent to score big points in Samorin.</p>
<p>We’ll get to see which athletes will be pitted against each other at the Match Draft Draw, part of the opening ceremony on Wednesday 25 August at 18:00 CEST.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Team US has been labelled as the underdog in the run-up to the first-ever Collins Cup event. But with a line-up of mentally and physically strong athletes who are highly motivated to take the Collins Cup trophy for triathlon’s founding nation, they shouldn’t be counted out.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In fact, with the Captains Picks adding two Olympic medallists to the women’s side of the team, their chances of causing an upset have jumped up drastically. Here’s the lowdown on the full team and why the Stars-and-Stripes are serious contenders for the Collins Cup.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skye Moench has cemented her place as the USA number one thanks to a string of powerful performances including the win at 70.3 Texas in April and third at Ironman Tulsa in May. Moench also showed off her solid swim, superb bike and strong run as the top Stars-and-Stripes finisher at 70.3 St. George, coming fifth in a championship-quality field. While she’s an Ironman star, fifth at the shorter distance Challenge Miami also bodes well for the Collins Cup.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With her great swim and bike rankings plus a sensational run that’s up there with the best, Jackie Hering is a quality athlete across the board. This year she’s had some great performances including third at both Challenge Miami and 70.3 Des Moines as well as two more 70.3 top-10 finishes. If Hering brings her freshest running legs to the Collins Cup, she could certainly pull in the points for Team US.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chelsea Sodaro (PTO #22) returned from maternity leave to come sixth at 70.3 Boulder on the final weekend of Collins Cup qualification races, giving her enough points to squeeze into the fourth position for the US – fulfilling the dream laid out in her Greater Than One video series. Before that, her 2019 season features three 70.3 wins and as a strong athlete in all three disciplines, this super-mom could show up her rivals.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jocelyn McCauley was drafted into the team after original qualifier Heather Jackson pulled out of the race for personal reasons. McCauley’s a strong replacement, however, having returned from maternity leave to take second place at IM Finland. Already back to fine form on the swim and bike, if she can sharpen her run just a little, she could be a real asset to Team US in Samorin.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For both the Captains Picks, Karen Smyers and Mark Allen have gone straight to the top. Tokyo 2020 Olympic Bronze medallist Katie Zaferes, who also took Silver in the Mixed Relay event, is their first choice. What a choice it is. One of the best in the business, the 2019 World Triathlon Champion is a front-pack swimmer, breakaway biker and stellar runner. While this is a longer distance than she’s previously competed at, there won’t be many from the other teams who can match her.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second pick is fellow Olympian athlete Taylor Knibb, who was also part of that Silver-winning relay team in Japan. After quickly making a name for herself as a sensational swimmer and the strongest cyclist on the World Triathlon circuit, Knibb stepped up to middle distance for the first time at 70.3 Boulder earlier this month. Finishing in second, she rode just 26-seconds slower than winner Pallant-Browne despite being on a road bike. </span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the men’s side, Sam Long leads the pack. He’s in stellar form after victories at IM Coeur d’Alene and 70.3 Boulder and we’ve also seen how deep he can push in a head-to-head battle when he went to the line against Lionel Sanders at 70.3 St. George. One of the sport’s fastest bike-runners – and still far from his potential at just 25 years old – Long could do serious damage to his competitors in Samorin.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Like Long, Rudy Von Berg scored a victory earlier this month by taking the tape at 70.3 Switzerland. A fantastic athlete in all three disciplines, Von Berg is a picture of consistency having been in the top five for all but one of his last 25 races – 10 of which were wins. With no weaknesses, he’ll be a contender no matter the matchup.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Through the 2020-2021 season Matt Hanson has proven himself as the sport’s best middle-distance runner, taking the fastest splits at five out of the last six events he’s raced – including the PTO 2020 Championships in Daytona, where he came second. He’s got a good swim and a fast bike too, so if he hits T2 at the same time as his opponents, he’s odds-on for victory at the Collins Cup.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ben Kanute is without doubt one of the sport’s most versatile athletes. Able to race hard and fast over a plethora of distances, Kanute is a highly accomplished all-rounder with a weapon swim that’s seen him take third at Challenge Miami, second at 70.3 Texas and first at Escape From Alcatraz in 2021. That win – his fourth at the iconic event – came on 15 August, showing he’s in fine form.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another strong all-rounder, Captains Pick recipient Justin Metzler is a classy athlete who’s been racing well this season with three top-10 results including second at IM Coeur d’Alene and fifth at 70.3 Boulder. To add a little familial drama to the Collins Cup, Justin’s wife, Jeanni Metzler, is racing for Team Internationals, which could cause sparks to fly in race week!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The captains’ other pick, Chris Leiferman, has had to forego his slot due to injury, which has paved the way for alternate Andrew Starykowicz to be called up. A strong swimmer and the uber-biker&#8217;s uber-biker, Starykowicz took first at Rev3 Williamsburg earlier this year and is a tactical pick if ever the was one. A player of mind games and speaker of frank views, Starykowicz will bring as much in the way of controversial asides as his pure cycling power.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With a ton of talent across the team and two seriously decorated Captains calling the shots, the right matchups could see the US top the points table in Samorin. </span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It was no surprise that Daniela Ryf retained her PTO #1 spot throughout the qualifying period to lead Team Europe’s women incredible list of women. The nine-time world champ has continually raised the game of long-course triathlon to leave others playing catch-up. The Swiss star has continued her dominance in 2021, taking four-from-four victories.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Like Ryf, Anne Haug is also a Kona winner having taken victory in 2019. The German is a good swimmer and strong biker, but it’s Haug’s run that strikes fear into the competition. She’s still getting quicker, too, beasting Challenge St Polten earlier this year with a 1:14:07 run split – the fastest ever at a middle-distance race.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lucy Charles-Barclay is the sport’s preeminent swimmer at any distance but she’s also proved her bike and run class time and again – including her 70.3 European Championship win in Elsinore this June. The Brit has also raced well in Samorin previously having won Challenge Samorin in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2016 70.3 world champ Holly Lawrence is a true all-rounder who can out-swim, out-bike and out-run the majority of the pro field. The Brit comes into the Collins Cup having already beaten some of the other teams’ athletes at 70.3 Des Moines this year. She also came second at the 70.3 European champs this year.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Captains’ pick Emma-Pallant Browne might not match the uber-swimmers for speed, but she certainly makes up for it in cycling power and foot speed. Seemingly able to bridge gaps on the bike with ease then run away from the rest, the Brit has topped the podium at four of her six races this year – and taken second and third at the others.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kat Matthews is the fourth Brit in Team Europe and comes to the race in rising form, most recently winning Ironman UK and before that coming second to Daniel Ryf at IM Tulsa. It was there that she ran a 2:49:48 marathon, the fastest of any woman in the last five years.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The men’s side of the team is no less decorated. PTO #1 Jan Frodeno leads the charge. The five-time world champion is rightly regarded as the sport’s best and hasn’t lost a race since 2017. On top of that, he’s just set a new iron-distance world record of 7:27:53 showing the German’s not slowing down.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Norway’s Gustav Iden comes to the Collins Cup as reigning 70.3 World Champion and PTO 2020 World Champion having won Challenge Daytona in spectacular fashion last December. An eighth at the Olympic Games since then will only have improved his middle-distance form.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joe Skipper is a thoroughbred racing monster with the confidence and attitude to match. He’s likely to lose time in the swim, but the Brit is holder of the fastest ever Ironman bike-run combo. More an iron-distance specialist. Skipper won Ironman UK earlier this year with a colossal run effort of 2:41:44 on a very challenging course.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two-time Kona winner Patrick Lange is known as one of the fastest iron-distance runners ever but his exceptional performance to win Ironman Tulsa in May shows he really is a complete athlete. With a great swim, much-improved bike and staggering run, the German will be a fearsome matchup if he can translate that speed to middle-distance.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daniel Baekkegard must’ve been an easy pick for the Team Europe Captains, being one of the athletes that everyone is talking about in 2021. After kicking off the season with the win at 70.3 Dubai, he raced 70.3 St. George where despite a confusing DQ, the Dane showed his all-around swim-bike-run class in a championship-quality field. The grit he showed to hang tough and come third at IM Tulsa must only have made Baekkegard a more appealing choice for Team Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sebastian Kienle is the biggest surprise pick from the Team Europe Captains – not because of his considerable resumé, which includes two 70.3 world titles, a Kona win and the course record at Challenge Samorin – but because of the injuries that have seen him at less than 100 percent this season. He’s not raced since May so this pick from captains Natascha Badmann and Normann Stadler surely means the German is back to his best – and that’s a frightening prospect for the other teams.</span></p>

Meanwhile, the women are in action at 70.3 Timberman, which makes a return to the calendar for the first time since 2016.</p>
<h2>Ironman Copenhagen 2021 Race Preview</h2>
<p>With a male-only field and two Kona spots on the line, IM Copenhagen has a long list of starters topped by Collins Cup Team Internationals #1 athlete Lionel Sanders.</p>
<p>Date: 22 August<br />
Location: Copenhagen, Denmark<br />
Start Time: 05:00 UTC<br />
Prize Money: $50,000 – pays 10 deep $15,000 to $1,000<br />
Course: Ocean swim, rolling bike, rolling run</p>
<h2>Top-ranked Athletes (Non-IM Frankfurt racers)</h2>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders"">Lionel Sanders</a> (PTO #2) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jesper-svensson"">Jesper Svensson</a> (PTO #58) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/yvan-jarrige"">Yvan Jarrige</a> (PTO #77)</p>
<p>Lionel Sanders is the standout athlete racing in Copenhagen, the Canadian stopping in Denmark on the way to the Collins Cup with the aim of securing his trip to Hawaii. His last attempt to grab a slot at IM Coeur d’Alene was blighted by gastro issues, though he seemed stronger in that department at the Tri Battle Royale. But with championship season getting underway, this is probably his last shot for 2021.</p>
<p>Of the athletes signed up for Copenhagen who didn’t race last weekend at IM Frankfurt, Jesper Svensson is the top ranked. One of the many DNFs at IM Tulsa in May, his last iron-distance result was eighth in Florida in 2019.</p>
<p>Next up is France’s Yvan Jarrige an all-rounder to took third at IM 70.3 Les Sables in July. Also keep a lookout for Britain’s <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/elliot-smales"">Elliot Smales</a> (PTO #82), who will be looking to go a couple of steps higher than his fourth place at IMUK to clinch a Kona spot.</p>
<p>Of the athletes on the start list who raced in Frankfurt but didn’t get a ticket to Hawaii, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/maurice-clavel"">Maurice Clavel</a> (PTO #47), <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/david-plese"">David Plese</a> (PTO #70) and <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/marcus-herbst"">Marcus Herbst</a> (PTO #75) are the highest ranked. But whether they’ll be backing up just a week after an iron-distance effort is a long shot.</p>
<h2>Ironman 70.3 Timberman</h2>
<p>A strong field of women are set to race at Timberman 70.3, which makes a welcome return to the circuit five years since its last running, albeit in a new venue.</p>
<p>Date: 22 August 2021<br />
Location: Laconia, New Hampshire, USA<br />
Time: 10:50 UTC<br />
Prize Money: Prize Money: $25,000 – pays 8 deep $7,500 to $1,000<br />
Course: Lake swim, rolling bike, rolling run</p>
<h2>Top-ranked Athletes</h2>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jeanni-metzler"">Jeanni Metzler</a> (PTO #11) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/heather-jackson"">Heather Jackson</a> (PTO #14) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/linsey-corbin"">Linsey Corbin</a> (PTO #29)</p>
<p>Jeanni Metzler tops the list, the South African super-runner getting in a tune-up race before heading to the Collins Cup as a key player on Team Internationals.</p>
<p>Heather Jackson is likely to be the biggest test for Metzler. The US star will be looking to banish the memories of a tough marathon at IM Lake Placid with a strong performance before championship races get underway.</p>
<p>Linsey Corbin will be sharpening her speed here after coming third at IM Coeur d’Alene in June. Expect to see her come through stronger and stronger as the race progresses.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sarah-piampiano"">Sarah Piampiano-Lord</a> (PTO #39) came back from maternity leave with a creditable eighth place at 70.3 Boulder a couple of weeks ago. She’s back in action at Timberman this weekend in her bid to return to the top.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lisa-becharas"">Lisa Becharas</a> (PTO #59) is having a solid season so far with three top-10 performances on the US 70.3 circuit. A strong swimmer and biker, Becharas will need a big run to duke it out with the best on two legs at Timberman.</p>
<p>Speaking of the best running legs on the start list, former Canadian track and field star <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/tamara-jewett"">Tamara Jewett</a> (PTO #65) is one to watch. Winner of the 2020 Canadian Pro Championships, Jewett came fifth at 70.3 Boulder with the day’s fastest run split – a fleet-footed 1:16:50. If she continues to improve her swim and bike, she’ll be a real contender – watch this space for Collins Cup 2022!</p>
<p>Finally, three-time Kona winner – and defending Timberman champ from 2016 – <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/mirinda-carfrae"">Mirinda Carfrae</a> will be making her return to racing seven months after giving birth. We’re unlikely to see her jump right back into a dominant position, but Timberman will be a good tester to see how close she is to her pocket rocket best.</p>

<p>For 2021, the men’s and women’s IM Euro champs take place at different races. The men will do battle at IM Frankfurt and the women at the inaugural IM Finland, each race featuring a $75k prize purse and three Kona slots.</p>
<p>As is regular in the fight for IM World Champs qualification, some athletes have their names down for several conflicting event dates, making start lists a little fluid – but here’s who we’re expecting to toe the line at these key Ironman events.</p>
<h2>Ironman Finland 2021 Preview</h2>
<p>This female pro-only race has a strong field gunning for the Ironman European title. Key players include PTO #20 Imogen Simmonds, PTO #32 Manon Genet and PTO #34 Laura Philipp.</p>
<p>Whoever takes the win will set a course record for this first-time event, which features a one-lap lake swim, two-lap bike with 1100m of climbing and a four-lap rolling mixed-terrain run. Temperatures could be chilly and rain could cool athletes further, which could enhance or diminish performance depending on the athlete.</p>
<p>Date: 14 August<br />
Location: Kuopio-Tahko, Finland<br />
Start Time: 04:30 UTC<br />
Prize Money: $75,000 – pays 10 deep $12,000 to $1,000<br />
Course: Lake swim, rolling bike, rolling run</p>
<h2>Top-ranked Athletes</h2>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/imogen-simmonds"">Imogen Simmonds</a> (PTO #20) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/manon-genet"">Manon Genet</a> (PTO #32) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp"">Laura Philipp</a> (PTO #34)</p>
<p>Imogen Simmonds is an all-rounder who can really put the hammer down and is likely to out-swim Lauran Philipp – probably her biggest rival here – to take an early lead. Second only to Kona champions <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-ryf"">Daniela Ryf</a> at 70.3 Dubai and <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-haug"">Anne Haug</a> at Challenge St Polten, the Swiss athlete is in great form this year and, like Philipp, is still looking for Kona qualification.</p>
<p>Laura Philipp was fourth in Hawaii in 2019 and third at the PTO 2020 Championships in Daytona last December but hasn’t raced since due to Covid and a hip injury – hence her lower ranking. She’s made the most of the situation with extra pool time to improve her swimming and combining that with her exceptional bike and run speed will make her even more of a threat for the win in Finland.</p>
<p>France’s Manon Genet has refocused on her training and recovery following her DNF at Ironman Lanzarote in July but expect her to put it all out there in Finland to get her ticket to Hawaii. She’ll likely be chasing out the water but could find herself in good company with the other strong bikers. From there, her power on two wheels and two legs should keep her in contention.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jocelyn-mccauley"" class="""">Jocelyn McCauley</a> (PTO #41) raced 70.3 Boulder just last weekend, her first event back after maternity leave. Ninth there was a disappointment for the American so just a week on she’s battling jet lag in Finland to go double the distance. In 2019, McCauley came tantalisingly close to beating PTO #1 Daniela Ryf at Ironman Texas – just two minutes down but nearly 20 minutes ahead of the rest of the field. Once she can recapture that form, she’ll be rising back up the rankings.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/svenja-thoes"">Svenja Thoes</a> (PTO #44) is the final top-50 ranked athlete on the start list. The German came second at 70.3 Andorra in early July and is likely to be one of the powerful bikers getting out the water with time to make up.</p>
<p>Renee Kiley (PTO #57) has already raced three Ironmans this year but has just missed out on qualification. Like Philipp and Genet, she’ll won’t be up front after the swim, but her mega bike power could see her drive to the head of the race after that to put herself in podium contention.</p>
<p>Also look out for 2019 World Triathlon Long Course Champion <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/alexandra-tondeur"">Alexandra Tondeur</a> (PTO #63), who came third at Alpe D’Huez Long Course and fifth at 70.3 Switzerland – if three straight weekends of racing don’t catch up with her!</p>
<p>If she races, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/joanna-ryter"">Joanna Ryter</a> (PTO #64) is also one to watch on the run after her race-best split at IM Lake Placid – 13-minutes faster than any other competitor – earned her third there.</p>
<h2>Ironman Frankfurt 2021 Preview</h2>
<p>The male-only companion to the women’s European champs in Finland, Ironman Frankfurt is one of the few chances left to gain a start in Kona this year. As such, there’s a long list of quality athletes, which should make for some close racing in Germany.</p>
<p>Established on the circuit since 2002, Frankfurt features a two-loop swim with a short Australian exit between each before a two-lap bike course with over 1900m of climbing and a flat, four-lap marathon. With temperatures set to near 30°C, heat could play a factor in the outcome here as in previous years.</p>
<p>Date: 15 August<br />
Location: Frankfurt, Germany<br />
Start Time: 04:25 UTC<br />
Prize Money: $75,000 – pays 10 deep $12,000 to $1,000<br />
Course: Lake swim, rolling bike, flat run</p>
<h2>Top-Ranked Athletes</h2>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/andi-boecherer"">Andi Boecherer</a> (PTO #34) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/pieter-heemeryck"">Pieter Heemeryck</a> (PTO #37) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/cameron-wurf"">Cam Wurf</a> (PTO #38)</p>
<p>The highest place starter on the PTO World Rankings, Andi Boecherer is already Kona-qualified. However, the German will be looking to take the win here having previously come second twice back in 2016 and 2017. In fine form this season, Boecherer took the win at IM Lanzarote in July. His bike is his weapon, but he’s a strong athlete across the board with a rating of 90%.</p>
<p>Of the athletes seeking a Kona ticket, Pieter Heemeryck is the highest ranked. The German has struggled this year with back problems which led to a 26th-place finish for his Ironman debut in Lanzarote but with things looking up, he could contend for the podium here thanks to great all-round swim-bike-run strength.</p>
<p>Also aiming to get in the top three and book flights to the Big Island, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/tom-davis"">Tom Davis</a> (PTO #40) needs a break from his bad luck in 2021 to show his true potential. A great swimmer, he could lead Heemeryck and Maurice Clavel out the water and stay up there on the bike. Then it’ll be down to how his legs hold up on the marathon – only his second ever at the end of an iron-distance race.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/maurice-clavel"">Maurice Clavel</a> (PTO #47) has been targeting a home-soil win in Frankfurt, putting in a preparation block in the mountains of St. Moritz. The German showed good form with third at Challenge St Polten in May and is another strong swimmer who could form part of that bike front pack and duke it out for the podium.</p>
<p>Rather than qualification, Cam Wurf will be looking for more race experience this year after focusing on cycling with the Ineos Grenadiers. He struggled on the run to a fifth-place finish at the PTO-supported 140.6INN International Triathlon in May but managed third at 70.3 Andorra in July. If he’s back to his 2019 form, when he won IM Italy in 7:44, he could take victory here.</p>
<p>As a championship race, many of the names on the start list could factor in the standings at Frankfurt. Athletes to watch include <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/david-mcnamee"">David McNamee</a> – a two-time Kona podium getter – will need a big performance to get back to the Big Island after struggling with burnout earlier this year and Sweden’s <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/patrik-nilsson"">Patrik Nilsson</a> who came second here to <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-frodeno"">Jan Frodeno</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>Also keep an eye on rookie <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/casper-stornes"">Casper Stornes</a>, the Norwegian teammate of Olympic Champion Kristian Blummenfelt and PTO 2020 Champion Gustav Iden. As part of Norway’s formidable short-course squad, there’s no telling what sort of a performance Stornes could pull out in his bid to join Blummenfelt, who’s already been gifted a world champs slot, in Kona.</p>

<p>Team Europe #4 Holly Lawrence has had a couple of great results this year that have indicated a return to the form that saw her so dominant in 2019. In Des Moines, she topped the podium, beating challengers racing here including Emma Pallant-Browne and Jeanni Metzler. Meanwhile at the 70.3 European champs just a week later, Lawrence came second only to Collins Cup teammate <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lucy-charles-barclay"">Lucy Charles-Barclay</a>.</p>
<p>Skye Moench is certainly deserving Team US #1 status thanks to her win at 70.3 Texas, fifth at 70.3 St. George and third at IM Tulsa this year. Moench’s place at the Collins Cup is almost assured but if she can defend her title here from 2019 to beat Lawrence and Jeanni Metzler, it could land a psychological blow to Team Europe and Team Internationals rivals ahead of Samorin.</p>
<p>In Jocelyn McCauley (PTO World #10) and <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro"">Chelsea Sodaro</a> (PTO World #11), we have a pair of proven performers taking on their first big races after coming back from maternity leave. In fact, depending how the points play out, they could slot into spots two and three for Team US and earn automatic qualification just by completing the race.</p>
<p>With Internationals #2 <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay"">Paula Findlay</a> recovering from a stress fracture and out of the race, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jeanni-metzler"">Jeanni Metzler</a> (PTO World #12 / Internationals #4) will be flying the flag for Team Internationals. With outstanding runs at 70.3 Texas and St. George, Metzler announced herself as one of middle-distance triathlon’s very best and a serious talent for the Collins Cup.</p>
<p>One athlete who will be a little less scared of Metzler’s run than most will be <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/emma-pallant"">Emma Pallant-Browne</a> (PTO World #13). The Brit has come extremely close to matching the South African this season and outran her (and the rest of the field) at 70.3 Des Moines, where she took second to Lawrence.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other strong names on the start list who could threaten the podium including Team US #6, 7 and 8 <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/alissa-doehla"">Alissa Doehla</a>, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/meredith-kessler"">Meredith Kessler</a> and <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lesley-smith"">Lesley Smith</a>.</p>
<p>Rising long-course star <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/pamella-oliveira"">Pamella Oliveira</a> (PTO World #44) will certainly be vying for the lead after the swim with <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lauren-brandon"">Lauren Brandon</a> (PTO World #69 / US #10) but don’t count out World Triathlon racer and recent Olympian <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/taylor-knibb"">Taylor Knibb</a> from having an impact in her first 70.3 race.</p>
<h2>Men’s Race</h2>
<p>In the men’s race, the field isn’t quite so deep but it’s still an international affair as Sam Long looks to safeguard his Team US #1 spot and see off the rest of the competition to show the USA should be feared at the Collins Cup. That will likely include coming through like a freight train on the bike before a powerful run.</p>
<p>Sam Appleton is a quality athlete we’re yet to see the best of in 2021. The Aussie is still as Internationals #3 thanks to his sixth place at the PTO 2020 champs in Daytona last December. However, the rest of the Internationals top-10 are within five points of taking his spot, meaning he’ll need to score well here to stay in the auto qualification zone.</p>
<p>One athlete who’ll be hoping to get across the line ahead of Appleton will be <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/tyler-butterfield"">Tyler Butterfield</a>. As Internationals #5 and one point behind the tallies of Appleton and <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/max-neumann"">Max Neumann</a> (Internationals #4), it could all make all the difference in making it to Samorin at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Also keep an eye out for the evergreen <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/andy-potts"">Andy Potts</a> (PTO World #45 / US #8) and <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/justin-metzler"">Justin Metzler</a> (PTO World #58 / US #10) the latter of whom will still be buzzing from his second place at Ironman Coeur d’Alene.</p>
<p>Ironman 70.3 Switzerland 2021 Preview</p>
<p>Ironman 70.3 Switzerland is another race with a strong field this weekend. The women’s race is highlighted by PTO World #1 and Europe #1 <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-ryf"">Daniela Ryf</a>, who’s odds-on for another domination here. If she wins, it’ll be her seventh consecutive victory at the event.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s a Collins Cup flavour in the men’s top three with the USA’s <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/rudy-von-berg"">Rudy Von Berg</a>, Australia’s <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/max-neumann"">Max Neumann</a> and Belgium’s <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/bart-aernouts"">Bart Aernouts</a>.</p>
<p>Date: 8 August 2021<br />
Location: Rapperswil-Jona, Switzerland<br />
Time: 05:55 UTC<br />
Prize Money: Prize Money: $30,000 – pays 8 deep $4,000 to $750<br />
Course: Lake swim, hilly bike, rolling run</p>
<h2>Top-Ranked Athletes</h2>
<p><strong>Men</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/rudy-von-berg"">Rudy Von Berg</a> (PTO World #9 / US #2) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/max-neumann"">Max Neumann</a> (PTO World #20 / Internationals #4) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/bart-aernouts"">Bart Aernouts</a> (PTO World #21 / Europe #9)</p>
<p><strong>Women</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-ryf-"">Daniela Ryf</a> (PTO World #1 / Europe #1) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-reischmann"">Anne Reischmann</a> (PTO World #75) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/alexandra-tondeur"">Alexandra Tondeur</a> (PTO World #99)</p>
<h2>Men’s Race</h2>
<p>Rudy Von Berg is unlikely to be unseated from his automatic qualification slot for the Collins Cup, but this superb all-rounder will be doing everything he can to take the win, score big points and get back to the top of the Team US rankings.</p>
<p>Having only raced Down Under in 2021, IM Asia-Pacific champ Max Neumann is something of a wildcard. In Swizerland we’ll get to see if the Aussie excels against European competition as he has done in Australia. There’s added spice for Neumann this weekend as Tyler Butterfield is racing in Boulder and is just a point shy of taking his automatic Collins Cup qualification spot.</p>
<p>Bart Aernouts is another quality athlete who’s had great results this year with the win at 70.3 Florida, fifth at IM Tulsa and third at Challenge Walchsee. Given the strength in depth of Team Europe, he’s quite a way from automatic qualification, but a win here against Von Berg and Neumann would make a strong case for a captain’s pick.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/andi-boecherer"">Andi Boecherer</a> (PTO World #36) is the final top-50 athlete on the start. The German recently won IM Lanzarote and has two fifth place finishes at middle-distance Challenge events in Gran Canaria and Riccione.</p>
<h2>Women’s Race</h2>
<p>In the women’s race, Daniela Ryf  is the big draw here, the Swiss athlete taking the opportunity to race on home soil ahead of the Collins Cup. Ryf is unbeaten so far in 2021 and there’s no reason to believe that streak will end in Rapperswil-Jona this weekend.</p>
<p>The nearest athlete to Ryf in the rankings is Germany’s Anne Reischmann, who recently won 70.3 Les Sables with the day’s best bike and run splits.</p>
<p>Alexandra Tondeur could be Reischmann’s biggest competition for the second slot of the podium, having just come third at Alpe D’Huez Long Course – though bouncing back a week after a race of such toughness could be a big ask.</p>
<p>Another athlete who could be in with a shot at the podium is Germany’s <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/kristin-liepold"">Kristin Liepold</a>. Always a solid racer, mixing it in the top 10 at big races, Liepold also holds the fastest ever Ironman marathon time of 2:41:57 at Ironman UK back in 2011.</p>
<h2>Ironman 70.3 Gdynia 2021 Preview</h2>
<p>Ironman 70.3 Gdynia in Poland another opportunity to gain Collins Cup qualification points this weekend and while the fields aren’t as strong as in Boulder or Switzerland, there are still some notable names lining up.</p>
<p>Date: 8 August 2021<br />
Location: Gdynia, Poland<br />
Time: 04:00 UTC<br />
Prize Money: Prize Money: $15,000 – pays 5 deep $2,500 to $500<br />
Course: Bay swim, rolling bike, rolling run</p>
<h2>Top-Ranked Athletes</h2>
<p><strong>Men</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/andreas-dreitz"">Andreas Dreitz</a> (PTO World #23) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/paul-ruttmann"">Paul Ruttmann</a> (PTO World #72) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/james-teagle"">James Teagle</a> (PTO #85)</p>
<p><strong>Women</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lucy-hall"">Lucy Hall</a> (PTO World #39) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/maja-stage-nielsen"">Maja Stage Nielsen</a> (PTO World #60) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/katrien-verstuyft"">Katrien Verstuyft</a> (PTO World #125)</p>
<h2>Men’s Race</h2>
<p>Top seed in the men’s race is Andreas Dreitz whose best 70.3 result so far this year has been third in Florida but the German also scored fifth in Texas and sixth in St. George against quality opposition. He’s likely to be down after the swim, but this uber-biker could bring things back before the run.</p>
<p>While Dreitz is the only athlete in the PTO top 50 on the start line, James Teagle is a rising star to watch. The former short-course European Cup racer is having a great season with wins at Challenge Gdansk, with the race-best 1:12:59 run split, and the PTO-supported Outlaw Holkham Half, again with the day’s best run. Teagle is also a front-pack swimmer and a strong rider, so expect to see him going for the win this weekend.</p>
<p>Paul Ruttmann is another name to keep an eye on having come eighth in the championship-quality field at 70.3 St. George in May. The Austrian beat plenty of top athletes on the day including PTO World #11 Matt Hanson, and PTO World #16 George Goodwin. That was thanks to him making up serious time on the bike and run after coming out the water in 44th place – expect a similar come-from-behind scenario here.</p>
<h2>Women’s Race</h2>
<p>In the women’s race, Lucy Hall is the top-ranked athlete. With a swimming pedigree that includes leading out the 2012 Olympic Games, Hall always puts herself in contention once out the water. The Brit is also great on two wheels and her run – which has always been her most challenging discipline – is continuing to improve. Hall was second at Challenge Gdansk and this return to Poland could see her claim her first long-course gold.</p>
<p>Hall’s biggest opposition is likely to be Maja Stage Nielsen. The Dane came third at Challenge St Polten and followed that with fourth at the 70.3 European champs in Elsinore. Stage Nielsen’s weapon is her run, so if she’s in shouting distance after the bike, she could top the podium here.</p>
<p>Katrien Verstuyft is the third-ranked athlete here. She didn’t race in 2020 but had solid results in 2019 – when she was never outside the top 10 – and came sixth in the recent IM 70.3 Les Sables D’Olonne.</p>

<p>In this edition of the Tri Bulletin, we cover the Olympic individual races, the possibility of seeing an Olympic Champion at the Collins Cup and Jan Frodeno’s spectacular new world record at the Zwift Tri Battle Royale. We’ve also got news of Natascha Badmann becoming Team Europe captain, Swedish dominance at IM Lake Placid and the final broadcast team line-up for the Collins Cup.</p>
<h2>Blummenfelt and Duffy Claim Olympic Gold</h2>
<p>Norway’s <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/kristian-blummenfelt-3767/"">Kristian Blummenfelt</a> (PTO World #10) and Bermuda’s Flora Duffy claimed Olympic Gold in two thrilling individual triathlon races at Tokyo 2020.</p>
<p>Blummenfelt had to work hard at the start of the bike to bridge to a group of faster swimmers, creating a big pack of favourites that stayed together until the T2. Running side-by-side with Britain’s Alex Yee and New Zealand’s Hayden Wilde, the trio shelled off all the other athletes with their savage pace until only they remained in the hunt for medals.</p>
<p>With around 1km to go, Blummenfelt put in his big attack – gritting his teeth with a relentless drive to the line the others couldn’t match. The Norwegian took Gold in 1:45:04 with an incredible 29:34 run despite the Tokyo heat, followed by Yee and Wilde.</p>
<p>In a rain-drenched women’s race, a swim a breakaway headlined by Flora Duffy, Britain’s Georgia Taylor-Brown and USA’s Katie Zaferes stayed clear of chasers on the bike. Taylor-Brown lost 22 seconds on the way to T2 due to a flat, but no one could match Duffy’s foot speed as the Bermudian pulled away from the start of the 10km.</p>
<p>Gaining more and more ground, throughout, Duffy crossed the line in tears after 1:55:36 of racing with a 33:00 run to claim Bermuda’s first-ever Olympic Gold medal. Meanwhile, Taylor-Brown managed to overhaul Zaferes for Silver while the American secured bronze.</p>
<p>Both Olympic champions have already qualified for the 70.3 worlds, having won events before Covid took hold – also making them eligible picks for the Collins Cup. Blummenfelt has stated his intention to win Kona this year and is set to do an Ironman in the coming weeks to qualify. At that point, he should jump up into at least fifth place for Team Europe in the Collins Cup rankings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Duffy, as Tokyo Gold medal winner and one of the fittest, fastest athletes on the planet will surely be an easy pick for Team Internationals captains Lisa Bentley and Simon Whitfield.</p>
<p>There’s still more exciting triathlon racing to come in Tokyo with this Saturday’s first-ever <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/tokyo-2020-olympic-mixed-relay-triathlon-preview"">Olympic Mixed Relay event</a>.</p>
<h2>Jan Frodeno Sets New Iron-Distance Record</h2>
<p>PTO World #1 <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/jan-frodeno-2179/"">Jan Frodeno</a> set a new iron-distance world record of 7:27:53 at the Zwift Tri Battle Royale in Allgau, Germany on 18 July.</p>
<p>Going up against Team Internationals #1 <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/lionel-sanders-2190/"">Lionel Sanders</a>, Frodeno put together a 45:58 swim, 3:55:22 bike and 2:44:21 run to secure the new world record – going 7:46 faster than his previous best set in Roth in 2016. Meanwhile, Sanders set a new PB of 7:43:28 thanks to a 50:58 swim, 4:00:26 bike and 2:50:31 run.</p>
<p>While Frodeno smashed the record over the Deutsche Triathlon Union-ratified course, it wasn’t plain sailing for either athlete. Heavy rain came down during the bike leg, compromising speed and adding a brisk chill factor as they rode at nearly 46km/h for four hours. On the run, Frodeno slipped on a section of wet carpet 10km in, landing hard on his hip. While a painful moment, Frodeno reportedly credited this occurrence as a key factor in his victory, the pain distracting from the same tightening back that forced him to walk in Kona 2017.</p>
<p>Both athletes slowed on the run, but Sanders had the worse time of it, the Canadian’s initial speed – set for a blistering 7:35 finish – costing him later on.</p>
<p>“That was hard, so unbelievably hard,” said Frodeno. “You haven’t done an Ironman for two years and you race it like a 70.3, that’s a mistake in the beginning…We dreamt of this but I didn’t have a time in my head. Lionel said he wanted to go 7:29 and I’m like ‘I’ve gotta go faster than that if he’s going 7:29’.</p>
<p>“Lionel is a great athlete who has pushed me further and further over the last two years.”</p>
<p>After crossing the finish with a grimace of agony, Sanders had a smile for Frodeno when he heard the German’s finishing time. “When he asked me to come, that’s an opportunity of a lifetime, to go up against literally your hero and to go toe-to-toe with him. I mean I don’t know how much I pushed him but it was an amazing experience…this is something that I’ll never forget for the rest of my life.”</p>
<h2>Swiss Miss Natascha Badmann Joins Collins Cup</h2>
<p>Six-time Kona winner <a href=""https://thecollinscup.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/captains-eur/"">Natascha Badmann</a> has been announced as a Team Europe Collins Cup captain. Joining Normann Stadler to oversee Team Europe’s roster of 12 athletes at the event, Badmann can call on 25 years of experience as a pro triathlete and play a crucial tactical role thanks to the Collins Cup’s F1-style comms system between captains and athletes.</p>
<p>Badmann’s rookie Kona performance saw her take second to Paula Newby-Fraser in 1997, a breakthrough performance that she followed up with wins in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005. Even a savage bike crash in the 2007 race – an accident that required two shoulder surgeries – couldn’t keep her down. In 2011 she won Ironman South Africa and in 2012, at the age of 45, she set the fastest bike split in Hawaii.</p>
<p>A 2021 Ironman Hall of Fame inductee, Badmann takes the place of Chrissie Wellington as Team Europe captain – the latter unable to travel due to Covid restrictions. Meanwhile, the <a href=""https://thecollinscup.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/captains-int/"">Team Internationals captains</a> have been paired back to two. With Craig Alexander and Erin Baker also unable to travel, it’ll be down to Lisa Bentley and Simon Whitfield to guide the likes of Lionel Sanders and Teresa Adam to victory.</p>
<h2>Swede Sweep At IM Lake Placid</h2>
<p>IM Lake Placid featured two Swedish victors in Rasmus Svenningsson (PTO World #95) and iron-rookie Lisa Norden (PTO World #41).</p>
<p>In the men’s race, Svenningsson, who won his Kona age group in 2018, wiped away his 2:45 swim deficit on the bike by 60km before pulling away from the rest to earn a 2:11 lead to France’s Arnaud Guilloux.</p>
<p>From there he put together a solid 2:51 marathon on the challenging run course to stay ahead and cross the line in 8:13:25. Meanwhile, Guilloux held off a fast-charging <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/joe-skipper-1859/"">Joe Skipper</a> (Europe #3 / PTO World #6) to claim second.</p>
<p>For the women, <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/lisa-norden-1738/"">Lisa Norden</a> came out the water with 4:09 to make up, which she did to end the bike with a 6:11 lead on <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/heather-jackson-2143/"">Heather Jackson</a> (USA #2 / PTO World #18). Jackson began slicing chunks out of Norden’s advantage – getting the gap down to 50 seconds at 31km.</p>
<p>However, Jackson was soon halted due to cramps while Norden ran strongly to a debut Ironman victory in 9:11:26. Jackson had to settle for second seven minutes later while Switzerland’s Joanna Ryter made a name for herself with a blazing fast 2:57:30 marathon to claim third.</p>
<h2>Collins Cup Broadcast Team Announced</h2>
<p>The full Collins Cup broadcast team will combine master storytelling, presenting talent and triathlon experts to provide world-class coverage of the first Collins Cup on 28 August.</p>
<p>Anchored by longtime cycling commentator Phil Liggett, the incomparable ‘Voice of Cycling’ will be joined by experienced presenters Charlie Webster and Alex Payne, who sports fans might recognise from Wimbledon and Rugby Union broadcasts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the triathlon expertise will come from Belinda Granger – a former pro and a familiar voice from the PTO 2020 Championship in Daytona, former World Triathlon commentator Barrie Shepley, multiple world champion and podcast host Greg Bennett and Olympic Bronze medallist Vicky Holland.</p>
<p>Just a month away, the Collins Cup will be broadcast globally by Eurosport and Discovery+ as well as LAOLA1 in Austria and FujiTV in Japan</p>

Tokyo 2020 Olympic Mixed Relay Triathlon Preview,https://protriathletes.org/news/tokyo-2020-olympic-mixed-relay-triathlon-preview/,AdmiralAdmin,"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 15:03:55 +0000",Racing,"{'@isPermaLink': 'false', '#text': 'https://protriathletes.org/tokyo-2020-olympic-mixed-relay-triathlon-preview/'}","The Mixed Relay Triathlon makes its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020 this Saturday – here are the nations to look out for.

<p>With 19 teams of four athletes doing battle for their countries at a blistering pace, the Mixed Relay is one of the most exciting and dynamic events of the entire Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>After years of campaigning by World Triathlon, the Mixed Relay’s inclusion this year brings this frenetic racing to a global audience and adds an extra level of team tactics around the Games as athletes are selected from qualifiers for the individual races.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>Each Mixed Relay team is made up of two women and two men with nations qualifying either through earning at least that number of athlete spots for the individual races, through the Mixed Relay rankings or by performing at a Mixed Relay Qualification Event.</p>
<p>The final selections for each team won’t be confirmed until two hours before the race – and there’s always the chance that some athletes might be ill or injured following the individual races, giving nations the opportunity to sub-in reserves.</p>
<p>Each athlete completes a super-sprint triathlon of 300m swim, 6.8km bike and 2km run in woman-man-woman-man order, tagging their next teammate in at the end of the run. The first team’s final ‘anchor’ athlete to cross the finish line will take the Gold.</p>
<p>There will be 19 teams on the start line – here are the countries to look out for along with their start numbers.</p>
<h2>Team France – #1</h2>
<p>Hot favourites for the first-ever Mixed Relay win, France were Mixed Relay World Champions in 2015, 2018, 2019 and 2020. They were also victorious in the 2019 Olympic test event.</p>
<p>There’s good reason for the country’s superiority in recent years. With Cassandre Beaugrand, Leonie Periault, (fifth in the individual race) and a choice from the men of Vincent Luis, Dorian Coninx or Léo Bergere, there’s incredible strength in depth for this distance. Luis is a two-time Super League Triathlon Championship winner, proving his mettle when it comes to short, sharp racing. He’ll also be desperate to lead France to the medals after underperforming in the individual race where he took 13th place.</p>
<h2>Australia – #2</h2>
<p>Team Australia came out on top against the USA in the 2017 Mixed Relay World Championships and took second and third in 2018 and 2019 respectively. They also took Gold at the Commonwealth Games in 2018 – the format’s first major games inclusion.</p>
<p>As the only nation to qualify three men and women for the Olympics, the Australians have plenty of choices when it comes to their team. Given his calibre, Jake Birtwhistle underperformed in the men’s individual race with 16th place, so will be going all out here – likely alongside Matt Hauser who cut his teeth at Super League Triathlon – but Aaron Royale is also a potential pick. On the women’s side, Emma Jeffcoat was the country’s highest individual-race finisher in 26th place while Ashleigh Gentle and Jaz Hedgeland – quality athletes with plenty of mixed relay experience – were both lapped out of the individual.</p>
<p>Were these athletes all saving themselves for a potential Gold in the Mixed Relay? The team has the strength to battle it out right to the line in the chase for a medal.</p>
<h2>Team USA – #3</h2>
<p>Team USA took the Mixed Relay World Championship in 2016 and more recently came third in the 2019 test event and took second behind France at the 2020 world champs.</p>
<p>Traditionally weaker on the men’s side, Morgan Pearson’s rise to one of the sport’s best runners and Kevin McDowell’s strong sixth-place finish in the men’s race, the extra year from the Games’ postponement will certainly play into the Americans’ favour.</p>
<p>Katie Zaferes’ scintillating Bronze performance in the individual race – and her previous two Super League Triathlon Championship wins – makes her a must pick while the USA can also choose from Summer Rappaport or Taylor Knibb, each of whom could help the Stars and Stripes earn a podium place in Tokyo.</p>
<h2>Team Great Britain – #4</h2>
<p>Despite Great Britain’s dominance on the World Triathlon scene, the Brits haven’t won a Mixed Relay World Championship title since 2014. However, the team only just lost out to France in a photo finish at the Olympic Test Event in 2019 while this year has seen them become European Relay Champions so there’s certainly medal potential.</p>
<p>Add to that the jubilation in the British camp from Alex Yee and Georgia Taylor-Brown’s Silver medals in the individual races and hopes will be high for more success. Jonny Brownlee will be all-in to earn a medal at his third consecutive Olympics while Jess Learmonth’s stellar swimming makes her a strong tactical pick, though the team could also opt for Rio Bronze medallist Vicky Holland.</p>
<p>All that makes Great Britain the biggest rival for France and potentially the stronger of the two nations.</p>
<h2>Team New Zealand – #5</h2>
<p>Riding high on men’s Bronze medallist Hayden Wilde’s spectacular performance, Team New Zealand – ranked fourth in the world at the Mixed Relay – could cause an upset. Wilde is joined by the ever-solid Tayler Reid, Ainsley Thorpe and Nicole Van Der Kaay – all part of the country’s winning squad for the 2019 Edmonton leg of the Mixed Relay Series.</p>
<p>While outside of Wilde they’ve not got the individual firepower boasted by other nations, they’re still in with a shot if the race goes their way.</p>
<h2>Team Belgium – #8</h2>
<p>Belgian speedmeister Jelle Geens missed out on the individual race due to a last-minute Covid-positive. However, he’ll be in Tokyo for the Mixed Relay and along with Marten van Riel – fourth in the men’s race – the country has a pair of super-sprint weapons. Meanwhile, the women’s pairing of Claire Michel and Valerie Barthelemy – 10th in the individual – are both strong athletes in their own right.</p>
<p>The team won the Mixed Relay qualification event in Lisbon in May and with this class of athletes, Belgium could be an outside chance for the podium.</p>

<p class=""p1"">If you follow the world of short-course triathlon and know your Taylor Knibb from your Tayler Reid and your Jo Brown from your <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/jonny-brownlee-1-/"">Jonny Brownlee</a>, the Tokyo Tri Fantasy Game is the perfect way to channel your excitement for the <span class=""s1""><a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/tokyo-2020-olympic-games-triathlons-all-you-need-to-know/"">Tokyo 2020 Olympic triathlon</a> races</span>. Use your budget to pick your team then see how they perform and find out how you fare in the global rankings.</p>
<h2 class=""p1"">How It Works</h2>
<p class=""p1"">All you need to do is choose a team of the top five male and female triathletes who you think will race the best in the individual Olympic triathlons. But before you go to town picking all the favourites, there’s a catch – you’ve got a limited imaginary budget of ¥350 to play with.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is your virtual seed money to spend on your team and each athlete costs a different amount based on their World Triathlon Ranking points going into the Games. So, the top-ranked male and female athletes at the Games – Spain’s Mario Mola and the USA’s Summer Rappaport – will set you back ¥55 and ¥49 respectively. Meanwhile, you can pick up some less well-known athletes from just ¥7.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As it’s based on the current rankings, there are some bargains to be had. A big favourite from our <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/tokyo-2020-olympic-games-womens-triathlon-preview/""><span class=""s1"">Tokyo women’s race preview</span></a>, Bermuda’s Flora Duffy, comes in at the tempting price of ¥34 while WTCS Leeds winner Maya Kingma of the Netherlands is only ¥28.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s a similar story on the men’s side with some stars from our <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/tokyo-2020-olympic-games-mens-triathlon-preview/""><span class=""s1"">Tokyo men’s race preview</span></a> available for a budget-friendly outlay. Britain’s Alex Yee, the men’s winner in Leeds and the sport’s fastest runner is a reasonable ¥33 while nine-time world champ and Olympic Silver medallist from London, Javier Gomez of Spain can be yours for ¥26.</p>
<h2 class=""p1"">Scoring</h2>
<p class=""p1"">Once you’ve picked your international squad of super athletes, all that there’s left to do is enjoy the edge-of-your-seat racing on offer in the men’s and women’s individual races – which take place on Monday 26 July 2021 06:30am and Tuesday 27 July 2021 06:30am (Tokyo time).</p>
<p class=""p1"">The new male and female Olympic Champions will each earn 1500 points. For every place after that, the points haul decreases by 7.5%, so you’ll get 1387.5 points for Silver and 1283.44 points for Bronze – right down to 22.27 points for 55th place. And of course, if your athlete doesn’t make it to the finish, there will be no points to claim.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The more points you have after both races, the higher you’ll appear on our global rankings where you’ll be able to compare how you’ve done against other triathlon superfans.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So, put on your triathlon pundit’s hat, make your predictions and get ready to hold bragging rights over your friends – or be the butt of a chorus of ‘I told you so,’ if you’re completely off base!</p>

<p class=""p1"">Taking inspiration from golf’s Ryder Cup, this new triathlon concept features three teams – Europe, US and Internationals – in a battle to see who rules triathlon. Each team has 12 athletes – six women and six men – who will race against their counterparts from the other teams in a series one-vs-one-vs-one battles over a 2km swim, 80km bike and 18km run.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Five athletes who are even now making their final preparations towards Olympic competition are within the top 50 of the PTO World Rankings and could make it to the Collins Cup – either through qualification or as one of the four wildcard captain’s picks for each team.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Here’s the lowdown on these superstar athletes who can balance competing at multiple distances with the highest level of racing performance. Don’t forget to check out our <span class=""s1"">guide to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games triathlons</span>, our <span class=""s1"">men’s race preview</span>, <span class=""s1"">women’s race preview</span> and to make your own picks in our <span class=""s1"">Tri Fantasy Game</span>.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Gustav Iden – Team Europe #2 – PTO World #4</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/gustav-iden-3335/"">Gustav Iden</a> might be seeking Olympic Gold, but he’s also got his eyes on the Collins Cup, 70.3 worlds and Kona after that. By taking the 2019 70.3 World Championship in Nice, Iden announced his arrival as a serious long-course talent. By following this up with a dominating performance at the PTO 2020 Championships at Challenge Daytona last December, he proved he’s one of triathlon’s greatest athletes. Whoever he faces in the Collins Cup will likely be racing for second.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Kristian Blummenfelt – Team Internationals – PTO World #9</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">After coming fourth in Nice at the 70.3 worlds in 2019, <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/kristian-blummenfelt-3767/"">Kristian Blummenfelt</a> went on to set the fastest ever middle-distance time in Bahrain – an eye-watering 3:25:10 including a 1:06:55 half marathon. With those two performances, it’s no wonder he’s sitting pretty in the points stakes. In fact, if he manages the unlikely feat of completing a qualification race before the 9 August cut-off, he’ll jump straight up into spot #4 for Team Europe and automatic qualification.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Javier Gomez – Team Europe #8 – PTO World #18</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Few, if any, triathletes are as experienced, talented and highly decorated as London 2012 Silver medallist <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/javier-gomez-2138/"">Javier Gomez</a>. The Spaniard can do it all – he’s got five World Triathlon championships, two 70.3 worlds wins, the ITU Long Course crown and an Xterra worlds victory for a total of nine world championship titles. He’s even dabbled in the iron-distance with a memorable 2019 victory in the heat and humidity of IM Malaysia. As a warm-up for the Olympics, Gomez won Challenge Cancun in May and while he might not hit automatic qualification for the Collins Cup, his years of tactical race experience alone will surely make him a tempting pick for Team Europe captains Normann Stadler and Natascha Badmann.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Henri Schoeman – Team Internationals – PTO World #31</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">2016 Olympic Bronze medallist and 2018 Commonwealth Gold medallist <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/henri-schoeman-3091/"">Henri Schoeman</a> is adept at everything from Super League to 70.3s. His all-around swim, bike, run ability was underlined with a seventh place at the PTO 2020 Championships at Challenge Daytona – a race he completed after recovering from terrible bout of Covid. A thoroughbred racer, Schoeman’s speed could be a big asset to Team Internationals this August.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Nicola Spirig – Team Europe #7 – PTO World #14</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">A five-time Olympian with Gold and Silver medals from the Games, three children and seemingly endless amounts of talent, 39-year-old <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/nicola-spirig-/"">Nicola Spirig</a> must be highlighted, circled and underlined on the Team Europe captains’ list of potential picks. Along with her Olympic success from 2012 and 2016, Spirig’s palmares also include an Ironman win, two 70.3 titles and two Challenge middle-distance victories – both of the latter raced in prep for Tokyo this year. All that adds up to the fact that Spirig is truly one of the sport’s all-time greats.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Vicky Holland</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">One Olympian we’re guaranteed to see and hear from at the Collins Cup is Rio Bronze medallist Vicky Holland. The fast-talking Brit will be putting her triathlon experience and fandom to great use as part of the Collins Cup broadcast. Holland will join lead anchor Phil Liggett, presenters Charlie Webster and Alex Payne and fellow triathlon experts Greg Bennett, Belinda Granger and Barrie Shepley in front of the camera – now that’s a formidable team!</p>
<h2 class=""p1"">Tri Fantasy Game</h2>
<p class=""p1"">Think any of the above athletes are in for a shot at Olympic medals this year? Don’t forget to include them in your picks for our latest Tri Fantasy Game. Purely in the name of fun, you can put on your triathlon pundit’s hat and make your predictions for the Games to earn bragging rights with your friends.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Start by selecting a team of your top five men and women. You’ve got an imaginary budget of ¥350 to play with and different athletes warrant higher values. Once your 10 athletes are in your squad, it’s time to sit back and see how they do! The winner of each individual race will get 1500 points with points decreasing by 7.5% for every position after that. The more points you end up with, the higher your ranking will be.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Five years since the last Games could be one too many for some of the favourites who were banking on a race in 2020, while new names have thrived and come to the fore ahead of the big day in Tokyo. Add in the effects of Covid on athletes’ training, limited racing opportunities and the high heat-humidity combination and it’s hard to know who’s going to arrive in Tokyo in the most scintillating form.</p>

<h2 class=""p1"">Race Dynamics</h2>
<p class=""p1"">The non-wetsuit two-lap 1500m swim, flat and corner-filled 40km bike course and flat 10km run make the Olympic course much the same as many World Triathlon Championship Series (WTCS) races. That means we’re likely to see a group of strong swim-bikers hoping to employ tactics already proven on the race circuit – create a breakaway that gains time on the chasers and hold off swifter runners to the finish. That approach could be even stronger here with fewer athletes from the strongest nations on the start list, meaning fewer feet to follow in the swim and a more broken up group.</p>
<p class=""p1"">However, with Olympic medals on the line, there will be a bigger incentive than ever for the chasers to ride hard and make the catch. There’s also plenty of firepower from the second-pack swimmers to do just that. If the breakaway doesn’t succeed, it’ll be a fascinating run with a savage pace from the first step out of T2.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Here’s who to look out for in this year’s women’s Olympic battle – along with their start numbers.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Maya Kingma – Netherlands – #1</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Maya Kingma has been a revelation this year, using the swim and bike prowess we already knew she had to get away from the rest of the field and create a buffer before T2. The difference has been in her run, which has come on significantly, helping her earn third place in WTCS Yokohama and first at WTCS Leeds this year to lead the World Triathlon rankings. With plenty of confidence from those performances, if the same game plan comes to fruition in Tokyo, the Dutchwoman could certainly come away with a medal and maybe even Gold.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Katie Zaferes – USA – #14</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Going into 2020 as the reigning World Triathlon Champion, Katie Zaferes was the athlete to beat and was the top pick for Gold in Tokyo. A year later and there was even a question around whether the American would make the team. With 23 WTCS podiums and six wins, Zaferes has been one of the sport’s most consistent top-level performers over the last few seasons. After tragically and suddenly losing her father earlier this year, the American has been a shadow of her former self, her best result being 18th place at WTCS Leeds. As one of coach Joel Filliol’s athletes, the saving grace could be that none of the squad – Olympic contenders all – have shown their best so far in 2021 and if Zaferes gives us that, she’ll be on the podium.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Nicola Spirig – Switzerland – #26</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">With a Gold medal from London and Silver from Rio, everyone will see 39-year-old <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/nicola-spirig-/"">Nicola Spirig</a> as a serious threat in her fifth Olympic Games. She’s not raced the WTCS this season but has a pair of middle-distance wins from Challenge Gran Canaria and Challenge Walchsee as well as a World Triathlon Cup win in Lisbon, so her form is right where she wants it to be. If she misses the front pack in the swim, expect her to be the key driver on the bike to bridge up to the leaders before unleashing a frightening run backed by her unmatched race experience to claim a third Olympic medal.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Flora Duffy – Bermuda – #29</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Flora Duffy will be the favourite for many going into the race. World Triathlon Champion in 2016 and 2017 and Commonwealth Games Gold medallist in 2018, injury side-lined the Bermudian for a while but she’s now back to her best and looking seriously dangerous. A top-class swimmer with the capacity to come out the water with the best, she’s also one of the strongest bikers in the field. Whether or not she gives herself the advantage of a successful breakaway on the bike, Duffy’s an incredible runner who’s the match of anyone else on the start list – proven with her race-best run split at WTCS Leeds. That means this all-rounder has more cards to play than most in her bid for Gold.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Cassandre Beaugrand – France – #30</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">A future world champion in the making, Cassandre Beaugrand is a great swimmer and one of the sport’s swiftest runners. If she can hang tough on the bike and come out of T2 with the leaders, that running class could keep her in the hunt for a medal. The 24-year-old is still on her way to cracking consistency at the Olympic distance, but showed great 10k form at WTCS Leeds, where she was only outrun by Flora Duffy and uber-runner Beth Potter. Beaugrand’s main focus is likely to be the Mixed Relay event so without the pressure to perform in the individual race, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see her end the day on the podium.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Vicky Holland – Great Britain – #32</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Along with Spirig, Vicky Holland is the only returning Olympic medallist in this year’s race – bronze from Rio. The 2018 World Triathlon Champion has described the Tokyo race as a ‘free hit’ with no pressure, a mindset that could see her coming away with another Olympic medal. Her only World Triathlon result this year has been fifth at a World Triathlon Cup in Lisbon, but having been selected back in 2019, her entire life has been set on peaking for Tokyo. If a good swim and bike can deliver her to T2 near the front, Holland’s running strength could yield more Olympic success.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Jess Learmonth – Great Britain – #33</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Once known only as a swimmer, Learmonth has proven herself as a force to be reckoned with across all three disciplines, taking Commonwealth Silver in 2018 and nine WTCS podiums including second in Leeds in June. Able to best anyone else in the water, Learmonth has ushered in a reign of breakaway superiority. In Tokyo, she’s bound to try the same aggressive tactic and if the likes of Flora Duffy, Maya Kingma and Georgia Taylor-Brown are with her, it’s hard not to imagine some if not all the medals coming from that group.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Georgia Taylor-Brown – Great Britain – #34</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">Completing Britain’s trio of medal contenders, Georgia Taylor-Brown is an all-rounder with amazing consistency having taken seven WTCS podiums and two wins from 15 starts. The 2020 World Triathlon Champion also took series silver in 2018 and 2019, showing her true class. She crossed the line first alongside Learmonth in the Tokyo test event – an action that saw both DQ’d – but has proven herself in the heat on the course. Taylor-Brown’s powerful run will frighten many of the field and if she begins the footrace in a leading position from a breakaway, a medal is on the cards.</p>

Fortunately, there is some incredible talent set to battle it out for glory.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Due to Covid, we’ve not seen athletes race as much as normal before an Olympics, so the form book gives an incomplete picture ahead of the race. Add in different restrictions around the world, athletes stretching their Olympic cycles for an extra year and the heat expected in Tokyo and it’s one of the most open Olympic races we’ve ever seen.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Race Dynamics</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With a non-wetsuit 1500m swim, flat but technical 40km bike course and flat 10km run, the men’s race dynamics could follow most similar short-course World Triathlon Championship Series (WTCS) events. That’s usually a fast swim with a doomed breakaway on the bike which is caught to create a big group with a footrace to decide the medals. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Deviation from that recipe here could come down to the depth of the 55-strong field. Here we have limited numbers for each country and some athletes who are likely to be under orders to act as domestiques or go easy ahead of the Mixed Relay. That could lead to things getting more stretched out than usual in the swim which could favour a breakaway. If a small, strong working group can get out of sight on the bike, we could be in for a thrilling cat-and-mouse as the fastest runners begin their hunt from T2.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here is a selection of athletes to look out for on the day – along with their start numbers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Hayden Wilde – New Zealand – #2</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hayden ‘The Falcon’ Wilde made use of his extra year of Olympic training by winning the NZ 5km National Championships in 2020 and 2021. Taking the latter in a scorching time of 13:43.53, he then surpassed that mark in February this year – going 13:29.47 on the track that puts him in contention with Alex Yee as the sport’s fastest runner. Wilde was third at the Olympic Test Event in 2019 – so has proven his talents against a strong field and the Tokyo heat – and raced aggressively at WCTS Leeds, where he faded to fifth. If he makes the front pack in the swim – or uses his bike strength to bridge up – he’s certainly a medal contender.<br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong><br />
Vincent Luis – France – #7</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2019 and 2020 World Triathlon Champion and two-time Super League champ, <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/vincent-luis-/"">Vincent Luis</a> is a stellar all-rounder with the winner’s mindset to boot. There’s no denying the Frenchman’s class or speed – he’s beaten every athlete in the Olympic field on multiple occasions and went into 2020 as the overwhelming favourite for Gold at the Games. Things have changed a little since then – at least outwardly. The only WTCS event we’ve seen him at this year was in Yokohama, where he finished a sub-par sixth, giving other athletes the hope that he’s human and beatable in Japan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Tyler Mislawchuk – Canada – #15</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Perhaps a little less well known than some of the other athletes on this list, Canada’s Mislawchuk earns a place here thanks to his spectacular performance in the 2019 Olympic Test Event where he beat Norway’s Casper Stornes and New Zealand’s Hayden Wilde to the top spot. A consistent and proven performer in the heat, 2021 has seen Mislawchuk chasing the sun with a World Cup win in Huatulco, Mexico, and another victory at the Americas Triathlon Cup in Long Beach, California on 18 July. All that makes him a worthy athlete all the others will have on their watchlist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Javier Gomez – Spain – #21</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of three previous Olympic medallists in the men’s field, opponents will be writing off 38-year-old <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/javier-gomez-2138/"">Javier Gomez</a> at their peril. A nine-time world champion across a variety of disciplines and distances, the Spaniard is a class performer through and through. Gomez knows how to perform on the big days and with the weight of expectation much lower than his Olympic turns in Beijing 2008 and London 2012, where he took silver, he’s got nothing to lose in Tokyo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Mario Mola – Spain – #22</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">World Champion in 2016, 2017 and 2018, Mario Mola has 16 World Triathlon series wins and 34 podiums to his name. While his run is his weapon, his main goal in Tokyo will be to have a strong swim and bike so he’s in a position to use it. Like Luis, Mola is one of Joel Filliol’s athletes, who, presumably by design, have yet to peak in 2021 with any top-level wins. If he’s up there at the start of the run, his experience and talent could certainly net him a medal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Kristian Blummenfelt – Norway – #43</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If Olympic Gold was awarded on pure guts and determination, it would undoubtedly go to <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/kristian-blummenfelt-3767/"">Kristian Blummenfelt</a>. Always racing full gas from gun to tape, Blummenfelt goes hard and doesn’t look back. Despite not usually being able to keep pace with the field’s fastest swimmers, the Norwegian 70.3 world record holder’s aggression on the bike and run means he regularly features in the mix. Winner of the WTCS event in Yokohama in May, Blummenfelt has shown great form this year. Let’s not forget the strength that comes from sharing the start line with fellow countrymen PTO World #XX and PTO 2020 Championship winner Gustav Iden and Casper Stones – second at the Olympic test event.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Henri Schoeman – South Africa – #51</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before taking Olympic Bronze at Rio in 2016, <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/henri-schoeman-3091/"">Henri Schoeman</a> was an outside bet. Since then, he’s become one of the sport’s most consistent performers with plenty of great results including the 2016 World Triathlon Grand Final and Gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. A stellar swimmer who can back things up with a strong bike and run, he’s one for targeting the big events and could well feature in the final selection in Tokyo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Morgan Pearson – USA – #53</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A former collegiate runner with a track 5km PB of 13:26.22, <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/morgan-pearson-/"">Morgan Pearson</a> has seemingly come out of nowhere to the top echelons of World Triathlon in 2021. The American secured his Olympic berth by taking third place in May’s WTCS event in Yokohama then followed this up with second behind Alex Yee at WTCS Leeds in June. On both occasions, it was his spectacular running that made the difference, but he’s also a great swimmer and biker. Brim-full of confidence after these top-level results, don’t be surprised to see him battling for the podium.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Jonny Brownlee – Great Britain – #54</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Second only to his brother Alistair in Rio, <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/jonny-brownlee-1-/"">Jonny Brownlee</a> is, without doubt, one of short-course triathlon’s most successful athletes with 31 WTCS podiums, 13 wins and two Olympic medals. However, his last Olympic-distance WTCS win was back in August 2017 in Stockholm and his only victories since then have been at the sprint distance – WTCS Edmonton in July 2019 and this year’s World Triathlon Cup win in Arzechena in May. That lowering of expectation could be exactly what Jonny needs to claim another Olympic medal – he has nothing more to prove and has already stated his desire to move up to 70.3 after the Games.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Alex Yee – Great Britain – #55</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Representing a changing of the guard in British short-course triathlon, Alex Yee is one of the up-and-coming athletes at the Games who’s benefitted from the event’s postponement, giving him the time to translate his promise into results. The sport’s best runner on paper, Yee won the 10,000m British champs on the track with a PB of 27:51 while his 5km best is 13:26. That running pedigree didn’t truly combine with an all-around triathlon performance until June’s WTCS race in Leeds. Yee’s vastly improved swim, aggressive biking and astonishing foot speed earned him the win and a spot on the British Olympic team. While the non-wetsuit swim in Tokyo might slow him a little, he’s now shown he can make it to the front and take Gold.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For short course athletes, the Olympic Games Triathlon is the pinnacle of the sport. It represents the culmination of a four-year cycle – five in the case of this year’s Games – of battling to earn the chance to represent their country. From there, the hard work has just begun as these speed specialists go head-to-head in a pressure-cooker bid for glory and the opportunity to be honoured forever as an Olympic medallist.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Perhaps we’ll even get to see a new Olympic Champion who’ll follow in the footsteps of 2008 winner and PTO World #1 <a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/jan-frodeno-2179/"">Jan Frodeno </a>– taking short-course tri’s biggest accolade on the way to becoming the biggest force in long-course racing.</span></p>
<h2><strong><br />
Triathlon Events At The Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As with each Olympics since triathlon’s introduction to the Games in 2000, we’ll have the men’s and women’s individual races to look forward to in Tokyo, both held over a 1500m swim, 40km bike and 10km run.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Triathlon fans will also have another opportunity to cheer on their country’s athletes thanks to Tokyo 2020’s inclusion of the first ever Olympic Mixed Relay event. This action-packed race follows the individual races and features four athletes per team. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Racing in woman-man-woman-man order, each athlete will each complete a super-sprint race of 300m swim, 6.8km bike and 2km run before tagging in their country’s next competitor. Some countries have even picked their athletes specifically to target a medal in this event rather than going for individual glory.</span></p>
<h2><strong><br />
When To Watch</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games Triathlons take place on three dates within the first week of the Olympics. The men and women race on consecutive days – 26 and 27 July – with a few days’ rest before the first-ever Olympic Mixed Relay triathlon on 31 July.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Men’s race &#8211; Monday 26 July 2021 06:30 Tokyo</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women’s race – Tuesday 27 July 2021 06:30 Tokyo</span></p>

<h2><strong><br />
Olympic Triathlon Race Venue</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Odaiba Park will host all three triathlon events as well as the paratriathlon competitions. With spectacular views of the city’s futuristic skyline across the stunning Rainbow Bridge, this small island – south of central Tokyo, between Koto City and Shinagawa City – could provide the most spectacular setting for an Olympic triathlon yet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While the location provides a unique viewpoint of Tokyo, all eyes will be set firmly on thermometers in the days leading up to the events. The races have been moved earlier to help mitigate fallout from the heat but temperatures are still set to soar to over 30°C while the humidity and even the chance of thunderstorms will be on the athletes’ minds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Olympic Triathlon Courses</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Individual Olympic Triathlons</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the individual races, a pontoon start just off Odaiba Beach will kick things off. Start positions will be decided by a blind selection process that could have a real bearing on the swim as athletes thrash it out for pole position by the first buoy. The swim will consist of two laps – one 1000m and one 500m for 1500m total – each heading out into Tokyo Bay towards Bird Island.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once out the water, athletes will grab their bikes from T1 in Seaside Park before taking on an eight-lap, 40km bike course through the West Promenade gardens up Wangan-doro Avenue and back past transition. While the elevation change hardly peaks at double digits, it’s certainly a technical course with over 10 90-degree corners and a pair of dead turns. This could favour a small breakaway with the space to take the turns at pace.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After T2 back at Seaside Park, it’s a 10km footrace over four 2.5km laps. Each virtually flat lap circles the park before taking athletes back to the edge of Tokyo Bay for the finishing straight that will crown this year’s Olympic medallists.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Mixed Relay</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Mixed Relay Triathlon features a more compact version of the individual course. The first athletes will begin on the pontoon with a 300m swim in the bay. Next is a two-lap 6.8km bike course that crosses the bridge towards Ariake Tennis Park. It’s another technical bike route with corners aplenty and three u-turns. Finally, there’s a 1km run around Odaiba Beach before handing over to the next athlete, who will perform a spectacular running dive into the water.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Athletes</strong></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">55 women and men from 38 nations have qualified for the Olympic triathlon races. Australia, Great Britain, Italy and the USA have all qualified the maximum of three women while Australia, Spain, France and Norway each have three men racing. Only Australia has hit the ranking criteria to take six athletes to the Games. Egypt, Morocco and Romania will all be competing in the Olympic triathlon for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the Mixed Relay event, 18 nations will line up, each with two men and two women – selected from the same pool as the individual races. However, the final start list, including the order of each team’s athletes, won’t be confirmed until two hours before the race.</span></p>

Fixing a tubeless flat in the winter is no fun, and I like the idea of being able to crawl somewhere warm for the task. Second, the few times I&#8217;ve had sudden flats on chunky gravel, the rim took some hits before I could come to a stop. I like the idea of having some protection of the rim.</p>

<p>That said, I&#8217;m wondering if I will like the feel of riding with tire inserts. Also, I wonder if I can bring myself around to relying on tire liners and not carrying a spare tube for the rare occasion I cannot plug the tubeless tire. Here, I cover the tire liner installation. Later, I&#8217;ll report back on testing the CushCore tire liners outside in the elements, with some intentional riding on a flattened tire.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Considering Internal Rim and Tire Width</h2>



<p>I set up two gravel wheelsets that I have on hand for product testing the Ekar GT groupset. The first wheelset is <a href=""https://www.campagnolo.com/us-en/zonda-gt/WWGZONDAGT.html"" title="""">Campagnolo&#8217;s Zonda GT</a> with an external rim width of 28mm and an internal rim width of 23mm. I decided to mount 40mm <a href=""https://www.challengetires.com/shop/products/getaway-xp/307871"" title="""">Challenge Getaway XP</a>s on this set. The second wheelset is <a href=""https://us.huntbikewheels.com/products/4season-gravel-wheelset"" title="""">Hunt&#8217;s Four Season Gravel</a> with an external rim width of 29mm and an internal rim width of 25mm. I decided to take advantage of the wide internal rim width on the Hunts and mount 50mm <a href=""https://www.goodyearbike.com/tires/connector/"" title="""">Goodyear Connectors</a>. My thought was to try and install liners with both a large volume, U-shaped vulcanized tire like the 50mm Goodyear Connector and a flat handmade natural rubber 40mm Challenge Getaway XP. Why the extremes? You know, for science!</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""473"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/comparison-1024x473.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67300"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/comparison-1024x473.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/comparison-300x139.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/comparison-768x355.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/comparison-1536x710.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/comparison-2048x946.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>Further, since the pairing of Hunt&#8217;s 25mm internal rim width with the 50mm Goodyear Connectors was approaching mountain bike dimensions, why not try the <a href=""https://cushcore.com/products/cushcore-xc?variant=49459968475447"" title="""">XC CushCore Liners</a> for 29er mountain bikes? It&#8217;s the same wheel diameter anyway (622mm). The XC Liners have an advertised range of 22-32mm internal rim width and 1.8-2.4&#8243; tire width. </p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""473"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/25mm-internal-1024x473.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67304"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/25mm-internal-1024x473.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/25mm-internal-300x139.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/25mm-internal-768x355.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/25mm-internal-1536x710.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/25mm-internal-2048x946.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>And since the pairing of the Zonda GT&#8217;s 23mm internal rim width with the 40mm Challenge Getaway XPs fell within the typical range for the <a href=""https://cushcore.com/products/cushcore-gravel?variant=49459957530935"" title="""">Gravel.CX CushCore Liners</a>, why not try those on that set? The Gravel.CX liners have an advertised range of 19-26mm internal rim width and 33-46mm tire width.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Avoiding Headaches</h2>



<p>Before you even think about beginning to install the tire liners, I recommend dry mounting the tires without the liners. You want to make sure you have a good seal with your rim tape and that the new CushCore valve you are introducing is seated sufficiently so that sealant will fill any voids around the valve. Replacing your tubeless valve with the CushCore one may disturb the rim tape or the new valve may be a slightly different shape. If this isn&#8217;t all checked as a dry run before you mount the liners, seat the tires, and add sealant, you will have a mess on your hands chasing any leaks. When the liner is installed it serves as an obstacle for swishing around the sealant where you&#8217;d like it to go for the initial setup and seal. In sum, test your rim tape and CushCore valve seal before introducing the liner.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""473"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/install-valve-1024x473.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67306"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/install-valve-1024x473.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/install-valve-300x139.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/install-valve-768x355.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/install-valve-1536x710.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/install-valve-2048x946.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Special Valve</h2>



<p>I was curious if the CushCore valve was necessary with the liners. Note that the CushCore valve has air holes on the top and sides of the end that is inside the rim. I tried the liners first with the valves that came with the wheels, which only have a top air hole. There&#8217;s no problem getting the air in, but the liner does fall on that top air hole when you want to let air out. The liner either seals that top air hole completely or partially, making it a slow process to lower your tire pressure. Therefore, use the CushCore valves with the tire liners. They do make a notable difference.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""546"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/valve-1024x546.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67307"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/valve-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/valve-300x160.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/valve-768x409.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/valve-1536x819.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/valve-2048x1092.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Liner and Tire Installation</h2>



<p>With a large volume vulcanized tire like the Goodyear Connector, the setup goes very quickly and can be done by hand without any special tools. The first step is to position the liner in relationship to the valve.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""535"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Align-Liner-1024x535.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67309"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Align-Liner-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Align-Liner-300x157.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Align-Liner-768x401.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Align-Liner-1536x803.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Align-Liner-2048x1070.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>Next the tire is mounted so that it drapes over the wheel and liner. This is easy to do with a large volume tire because the outermost circumference of the tire is so much larger in comparison to the wheel with the liner installed.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""631"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mount-Tire-1024x631.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67310"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mount-Tire-1024x631.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mount-Tire-300x185.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mount-Tire-768x473.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mount-Tire-1536x946.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mount-Tire-2048x1262.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>The next step is to push the tire under the liner so that the bead of the tire falls in the channel of the rim. With tubeless tires, the goal is always to seek out the smallest diameter of the rim to reduce the amount you have to stretch the tire. The rim channel is the smallest diameter of the rim. Always start opposite the valve and work your way toward the valve. The valve takes up precious rim channel real estate.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""577"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Push-Under-Liner-1024x577.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67311"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Push-Under-Liner-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Push-Under-Liner-300x169.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Push-Under-Liner-768x433.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Push-Under-Liner-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Push-Under-Liner-2048x1154.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>Once both sides of the tire have the beads in the channel under the rim liner, remove the valve core and seat the tire with an air compressor. The tire beads will snap into place with audible pops. Check to make sure the tire is evenly seated along the rim on both sides. There&#8217;s no need to maintain air in the tire.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""540"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mounted-Tire-1024x540.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67312"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mounted-Tire-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mounted-Tire-300x158.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mounted-Tire-768x405.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mounted-Tire-1536x810.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Mounted-Tire-2048x1080.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>I typically push the sealant into the tire through the valve after the tire is seated. In this case, I&#8217;m using Stan&#8217;s Race Sealant because it was already open. Once the sealant is pushed in, I like to clean out the valve of excess sealant before threading in the valve core. The last step is to air up the tire with a floor pump and swish around the sealant to take care of any small leaks. Hopefully, the valve is seated well enough in the rim bed so that air is not escaping around it. Be careful not to over tighten the CushCore valve nut because the rubber seal may squeeze out from underneath it and allow air to escape. With the CushCore tire liner installed, it can be tricky to swish around the sealant and get it to where you want to go. I recommend putting in 10-20 extra milliliters because the liner is introducing more surface area for the sealant to adhere to initially.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Tight Tires</h2>



<p>Installing the liners with a large volume, vulcanized tire like the 50mm Goodyear Connector was a piece of cake. No tire levers or special tools required. This is due primarily to the large outer diameter of the 50mm tire and the vulcanized production process that gives the tire a U-shape.</p>



<p>The smaller the volume of the tire, the more the outermost diameter of the tire decreases. The liner installation and tire mounting process is the same, but you may have to significantly compress the tire liner to mount a smaller volume tire. CushCore offers special tools, such as the <a href=""https://cushcore.com/products/bead-bro"" title="""">Bead Bro</a> and the <a href=""https://cushcore.com/products/bead-dropper"" title="""">Bead Dropper</a>, which is essentially a tire lever with a large handle. The Bead Bro may be best used in pairs because it can hold the mounted sections of the tire as you are working toward the valve.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Special Caution</h2>



<p>Handmade natural rubber tires like the 40mm Challenge Getaway XP require special caution when mounting in a typical setup and especially with tire liners installed. If too much force is applied to handmade natural rubber tires, you run the risk of stretching them out of shape. I have made this mistake before of applying too much force and stretched a natural rubber tire to the point that the tread was uneven after the tire was mounted. Without the proper technique, Challenge handmade natural rubber tubeless tires can be a chore to mount without a tire liner due in part to their flat shape. Eric Wynn has a few videos about <a href=""https://youtu.be/ZnVmsQxWl24?feature=shared"" title="""">mounting Challenge handmade tires</a> on the Slowtwitch YouTube channel.</p>



<p>If you decide to follow my lead of installing CushCore tire liners with a 40mm Challenge Getaway XP, I recommend mounting the tire without the liner to allow the tire to take some shape with use. Now, this is kind of a silly combination anyway, because the tire liner negates the suppleness of the handmade natural rubber sidewall. But remember, this is for science!</p>



<p>One of the 40mm Challenge Getaway XPs I was attempting to mount with the CushCore Gravel tire liners on the Zonda GT wheelset was used. I had a couple hundred miles of gravel riding on it at this point. </p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""600"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Getaway-40-1024x600.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67316"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Getaway-40-1024x600.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Getaway-40-300x176.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Getaway-40-768x450.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Getaway-40-1536x900.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Getaway-40-2048x1200.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>Following the same technique as described with the 50mm Goodyear Connectors, I was able to mount it by hand with minimal force. I did have to compress the tire liner to get the tire beads underneath the tire and into the rim channel.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""571"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/old-getaway-1024x571.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67318"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/old-getaway-1024x571.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/old-getaway-300x167.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/old-getaway-768x428.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/old-getaway-1536x857.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/old-getaway-2048x1142.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>However, there is no way I will be mounting the brand new 40mm Challenge Getaway anytime soon. The XC CushCore tire liner simply introduces too much diameter to the wheel to even complete the first step of draping the tire over both sides of the rim.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""546"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/new-getaway-1024x546.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67319"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/new-getaway-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/new-getaway-300x160.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/new-getaway-768x409.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/new-getaway-1536x818.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/new-getaway-2048x1091.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>The only way forward with this brand new 40mm Challenge Getaway is to mount it without the liner and leave it inflated for a while to allow the tire to stretch and take shape. Again, this is an extreme example of pairing a CushCore tire liner with a tight, handmade tire requiring care of installation. Using the Bead Bros and wrenching the tire bead with Bead Dropper would run the risk of damaging this natural rubber tire.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">More to Come</h2>



<p>I&#8217;m excited to get out on these wheelsets with the CushCore tire inserts installed. I trust that they&#8217;ll provide the rim protection that I&#8217;m looking for, but I remain curious about how they will change the feel of these tires. I understand CushCore&#8217;s argument that the tire liner can help prevent the tire from folding when pushing them in turns or berms at low pressures, but in the case of the handmade Challenge Getaways how they feel will also matter to me. Also more to come on both wheelsets and the Ekar GT group the wheels are being setup to test.</p>

There&#8217;s not much wiggle room there for a disappointing result, but Lange almost took the Pro Series last year despite a couple of weak 70.3 performances.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">CanadaMan Xtri Takes a Break for 2025</h2>



<p>Sad news for fans of what I&#8217;ve long billed as &#8220;Canada&#8217;s toughest triathlon,&#8221; the CanadaMan/Woman Xtri race in Lac Megantic, Quebec. Race organizers Endurance Aventure (look for a feature on the company and its two founders, Jean-Thomas Boily and Daniel Poirier, next week) announced yesterday that they will be &#8220;taking a break&#8221; from putting on the race in 2025, but plan to return in 2026. </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">WTCS Alghero Announced</h2>



<p>I covered the World Triathlon Championship Series (WTCS) event in Cagliari a few years ago. I have no idea how they make it all work &#8211; it was exclusively an elite race, so the Italian Federation would be on the hook for all the costs without any age-group entry revenue to offset any of the costs. (I assume there&#8217;s some tourism money and other sponsorship to help.) Sardinia is gorgeous, and Cagliari was a great spot to visit.</p>



<p>The new race venue, Alghero, is on the northwest side of the island, whereas Cagliari was on the south coast. Cagliari served as a WTCS event for three years and was a World Cup race for four years before that. According to a release from World Triathlon, there&#8217;s a three-year deal in place for the Olympic-distance race. The Cagliari course used for the last two years was dead flat &#8211; it&#8217;ll be interesting to see if the new venue manages to utilize any of Sardinia&#8217;s abundant mountainous terrain.</p>

<p>They love their World Triathlon events in Italy &#8211; this weekend Cogne, a town in the Aosta Valley in the north part of the country is hosting the Winter Duathlon and Triathlon World Championships. </p>



<p>Today&#8217;s duathlon events (2 km run/ 4 km cross-country ski done twice) saw Norway&#8217;s Jorgen Baklid take the men&#8217;s title, while neutral athlete Daria Rogozina took the women&#8217;s race. You can see the full results <a href=""https://triathlon.org/events/2025-world-triathlon-winter-duathlon-championships-cogne/results?programId=673705"" title="""">here</a>. </p>



<p>The elite Winter Triathlon takes place tomorrow and consists of an 8 km snow run, 12 km of snow mountain biking and 12 km of cross-country skiing. On Sunday there&#8217;s an age-group and Para triathlon over half the distance, along with the 2&#215;2 Winter Triathlon Mixed Relay for elites and U23/ Juniors. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">World Cup Season Opens in Napier</h2>



<p>There definitely won&#8217;t be any XC skiing in the mix in Napier this weekend, where the World Cup season kicks off. The races will be covered live on <a href=""https://www.triathlonlive.tv"" title="""">TriathlonLive.TV</a> with the women&#8217;s race going at 5:15 pm EST and the mean heading off a couple of hours later. </p>



<p>Italy&#8217;s Verena Steinhauser will wear race #1 in Napier, while American Erika Ackerlund will lead the small American contingent (she&#8217;s joined by countrywoman Danielle Orie). Kiwi fans will be cheering hard for two-time Olympian Nicole van der Kaay and fellow Paris Olympian from the New Zealand team, Ainsley Thorpe. Bermuda&#8217;s Erica Hawley was also in Paris last year. The Aussies team features Ellie Hoitink, Emma Jeffcoat and Richelle Hill (daughter of 2004 Olympian Rina Hill).</p>



<p>Luke Willian, who represented Australia at the Olympics last year, leads the men&#8217;s field in Napier, but will face some competition in the form of Kiwi Tayler Reid, who was at the 2020 Games in Tokyo. Others to watch in the field include Aussie Callum McClusky, Spain&#8217;s Roberto Sanchez Manticon and David Castro Fajardo and American John Reed.</p>



<p>The Napier Triathlon Festival has age-group racing as well and serves as the New Zealand Sprint Distance Championships.</p>

<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Last November <a href=""https://slowtwitch.com/cycling/canyon-issues-multiple-stop-ride-notices-including-speedmax-cf/"" title="""">we reported on a number of Canyon recall notices, including one for the Speedmax CF</a>, a popular triathlon bike. Canyon has been reaching out to customers directly, &#8220;but there are still quite a few riders who haven&#8217;t had their bike checked,&#8221; according to a Canyon spokesman. </p>



<p>Customers were contacted last December on the inspection and repair process. Canyon &#8220;discovered a safety issue in the fork steerer tube of the Canyon Speedmax CF fitted with the V21 Aerostem,&#8221; <a href=""https://www.canyon.com/en-us/customer-service/repair-spares-warranty/speedmax-cf.html"" title="""">Canyon reports</a>. &#8220;It is possible that after a severe impact or high load situation, like hitting a pothole at speed, the fork steerer tube could crack or break. This could lead to the cockpit becoming detached and cause a loss of control and potential injury to the user.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The first step is to make an appointment with a professional bike mechanic at a Canyon service partner for the free-of-charge repair work to be carried out,&#8221; Canyon wrote in a reminder notice. &#8220;This requires disassembling and removing the stem. If the steerer tube clamping area is not damaged, a reinforcement of the area will solve the issue. If damage is found on the fork steerer tube clamping area, the fork will need to be replaced and reinforced, which Canyon will supply at no additional coast.&#8221;</p>



<p>A list of Canyon service partners can be found <a href=""https://www.canyon.com/en-us/customer-service/repair-spares-warranty/bike-service-finder.html"" title="""">here</a>. For those who don&#8217;t have easy access to an authorized service provider (ASP), Canyon provided this update:</p>



<p><em>If riders do not have access to an ASP in their area, they should reach out to Canyon Customer Service to arrange a remote solution. While there isn&#8217;t a standardized solution, Canyon is committed to getting anyone taken care of that has a bike that falls within the recall. This could be in the form of a VeloFix mechanic performing the inspection and service (if available) or shipping their bike back to Canyon for inspection and fork replacement (if needed). </em></p>

<p>The winner of the USATF 100 mile Road Championships has been disqualified after it was discovered that his shoes exceeded the maximum allowable stack height.</p>



<p>Rajpaul Pannu crossed the finish line first at the<a href=""https://www.aravaiparunning.com/jackpot/"" title=""""> 2025 Jackpot 100 Mile Road Championships</a>, wearing a pair of <a href=""https://www.hoka.com/en/us/mens-everyday-running-shoes/skyward-x/1147911.html"" title="""">HOKA&#8217;s Skyward X </a>shoes. A post-race protest was filed, and the shoe was deemed to violate World Athletics (and by extension, USATF&#8217;s) maximum sole height of 40 millimeters.</p>



<p>Officially, the offending Skyward X measured 48 millimeters in the heel, and 43 millimeters in the forefoot. </p>



<p>Cody Poskin inherited the championship after Pannu&#8217;s disqualification.</p>



<p>Pannu, in a statement on social media, was not originally planning on wearing the Skyward X. “I initially thought they were trainers, too heavy to be considered a super shoe,” he said. “However, they seemed supportive enough for me to showcase what I’m capable of doing: running fast.”</p>

<p>Notably, it was not a fellow competitor that reported Pannu&#8217;s shoes to USATF officials. Instead, it was an interested party watching the livestream that appeared to have been the genesis of the investigation. “No one on the course cared about the stack height of my shoes. Not even the USATF official,” wrote Pannu.</p>



<p>As <a href=""https://www.slowtwitch.com/triathlon/on-ironman-and-prohibited-running-shoes/"" title=""On IRONMAN and Prohibited Running Shoes"">we wrote last week</a>, IRONMAN has adopted similar rules in its rulebook. The HOKA Skyward X has been <a href=""https://www.ironman.com/resources/rules-and-policies/prohibited-running-shoes"" title="""">added to the list of Prohibited Run Shoes</a> in an update on February 15th, along with the Puma MagMax Nitro.</p>

We&#8217;ll get to the results of all that momentarily, but today&#8217;s release also highlighted some of the demographics of IRONMAN participants, which were equally as interesting. </p>



<p>&#8220;The 2024 season saw more than 200,000 athletes register to race at IRONMAN and IRONMAN 70.3 triathlons, with the last year also seeing more younger athletes taking part in events than ever before,&#8221; we learned from IRONMAN. &#8220;The 30-34 age-group was the largest category for the first time, seeing an 8% increase from 2023, and the number of athletes under 30 years old registering for an IRONMAN triathlon saw a 25% increase year over year.&#8221;</p>



<p>In terms of country participation, the USA had the most athletes compete at IRONMAN events, ahead of Great Britain, France, Germany and Australia. There was a 16% increase in French participation from 2023. And athletes travel to IRONMAN races &#8211; over 70,000 of the entrants travelled more than 500 miles (800 km) to race. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Best(s)</h2>

<p>OK, so what races topped the awards? About 48,000 participants completed the post-race surveys. The races considered to provide the best &#8220;Overall Event Satisfaction&#8221; were IRONMAN Kalmar-Sweden and IRONMAN 70.3 Musselman. (Sadly I haven&#8217;t been to either event. I do remember the writer I assigned to cover the first race in Kalmar-Sweden in 2012 emailing me as soon as she arrived to say the venue was spectacular.)</p>



<p>Some other notes from the rankings:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Despite the incredibly tough bike courses at IRONMAN Wales and IRONMAN Lanzarote, athletes still rated them among the best overall</li>



<li>Athletes highly recommend IRONMAN 70.3 Bangsaen Thailand &#8211; how&#8217;s that for a destination race? Also high on the 70.3 recommend list? Michigan. (Another race I haven&#8217;t been to, but have heard nothing but great reports.)</li>



<li>The traditional Welsh weather hardly dampens people&#8217;s enthusiasm for IRONMAN Wales &#8211; it&#8217;s also near the top on the recommend list.</li>
</ul>

The post We Noticed: Bike Sherpa Expands to More IM Events, Run Brands Clearing Billions and More first appeared on Slowtwitch News .",https://slowtwitch.com/rss,"<p>The Bike Sherpa, the bike shipping arm of Race Day Wheels, is offering expanded shipping services to select 2025 IRONMAN and IRONMAN 70.3 events this year.</p>



<p>The company, which launched last year following the demise of TriBike Transport, has handled logistics and transportation services for brands and vendors to events for over 15 years. After a successful debut last year for the IRONMAN World Championships in Kona, the company will now also offer service to up to 9 IRONMAN and IRONMAN 70.3 events in 2025.</p>



<p>Those races include, but are not limited to:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>IRONMAN 70.3 Oceanside</li>



<li>IRONMAN Texas</li>



<li>IRONMAN 70.3 Chattanooga</li>



<li>IRONMAN Lake Placid</li>



<li>IRONMAN Chattanooga</li>



<li>IRONMAN World Championships &#8211; Kona, HI</li>



<li>IRONMAN Arizona</li>
</ul>



<p>Most races will require a minimum of 30 to 35 bikes for the service to be available at that event.</p>



<p>Services are familiar to those who have used transport services in the past. Customers select their pick-up location and will drop off their bikes at least 24 hours in advance of the stated ship day. You&#8217;ll then pick up your bike at the expo (or other select location) pre-race, race, and then drop the bike back off with the Bike Sherpa post-event.</p>



<p>The full event list, as well as details on reserving transport, <a href=""https://www.thebikesherpa.com/pickupdelivery"" title="""">can be found here</a>. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Run Shoes Proving Extremely Profitable for Brooks, ASICS</h2>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""682"" src=""https://www.slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Asics-Gel-Cumulus-27-1024x682.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-66959"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Asics-Gel-Cumulus-27-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Asics-Gel-Cumulus-27-300x200.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Asics-Gel-Cumulus-27-768x512.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Asics-Gel-Cumulus-27-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Asics-Gel-Cumulus-27.jpg 2000w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>It would appear that 2024 was a banner year for running shoes, at least for Brooks and ASICS, based on their recently announced financial results.</p>



<p>For Brooks, it was their third consecutive year leading the performance run category overall, including a 19% increase in the fourth quarter in the run specialty channel (that&#8217;s brick-and-mortar run specific shops, versus big-box or e-commerce sales). A full ten percent of all performance run shoes in 2024 sold were either the <a href=""https://www.slowtwitch.com/running/the-brooks-ghost-16-is-the-run-shoe-with-everything-you-need-nothing-you-dont/"" title=""The Brooks Ghost 16 is the Run Shoe with  Everything You Need, Nothing You Don’t"">Ghost</a> or Adrenaline GTS.</p>



<p>With ASICS, it&#8217;s their second straight year of profitability. North American sales grew by more than $130 million in 2024, totaling $891.8 million. The improved performance was driven by heavy gains in the run category, led by the NovaBlast 5 driving triple digit year-over-year growth. Also gaining share in 2024 were the updated Gel-Nimbus and <a href=""https://www.slowtwitch.com/running/a-first-look-at-the-asics-gel-cumulus-27/"" title=""A First Look At the ASICS Gel-Cumulus 27"">Gel-Cumulus</a> models. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Run Race Entries Up in 2024</h2>



<p>The total number of race entries went up in 2024, with RunSignUp reporting an 8% increase in total entries over 2023.</p>



<p>That growth, however, is coming mostly at events with more than 5,000 participants at them. Smaller races are still struggling, with 4% of events that took place in 2023 vanishing in 2024. However, there are some bright sports, with short races under 500 participants sitting at a growth rate of 10% year over year.</p>



<p>Price increases remain a primary friction point. Pricing is increasing at a faster rate at smaller, shorter races &#8212; 10Ks and under are up more than 5%, whereas marathons are only increasing their prices on average of 1%.</p>



<p>Race registrations remain a primarily late call for most runners. Although earlier registration often provides lower pricing, athletes are still registering for their races relatively late; more than half of fields register less than two months before race day. </p>

<p>We caught up James Elvery, one of the founders of the draft-detection technology company Race Ranger, at the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championships in New Zealand last December, and reported on the company&#8217;s plan to test its product with age group athletes at Challenge Wanaka. </p>



<p><blockquote class=""wp-embedded-content"" data-secret=""ovgMsJJCSi""><a href=""https://slowtwitch.com/triathlon/race-ranger-moves-to-age-group-racing-at-challenge-wanaka/"">Race Ranger Moves to Age Group Racing at Challenge Wanaka</a></blockquote><iframe loading=""lazy"" class=""wp-embedded-content"" sandbox=""allow-scripts"" security=""restricted""  title=""&#8220;Race Ranger Moves to Age Group Racing at Challenge Wanaka&#8221; &#8212; Slowtwitch News"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/triathlon/race-ranger-moves-to-age-group-racing-at-challenge-wanaka/embed/#?secret=eP7ZGeiVil#?secret=ovgMsJJCSi"" data-secret=""ovgMsJJCSi"" width=""500"" height=""282"" frameborder=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe></p>



<p>Elvery provided some notes after this weekend&#8217;s race in Wanaka, where 270 age group competitors at the half-distance race on New Zealand&#8217;s South Island. (A complete aside &#8211; Challenge Wanaka is supposed to be one of the most spectacular venues on the planet. I know, that has nothing to do with age-group drafting &#8230; just saying.)</p>



<p>&#8220;Something we wanted to get out of the trial was hands-on experience with age grouper bikes, and to understand the subtle differences between them and the pros,&#8221; Elvery reported. &#8220;It’s one thing to look at these bikes in transition areas, quite another to physically fit units to them. Of the 270 athletes that used the system, we encountered just one bike we weren’t able to mount a rear unit to. In this case it was a particularly small frame size Cervelo, and the whole rear seatpost area was taken up by the athlete’s rear water bottle, which was a seat-post mounted system. If they had switched this to a saddle-rails mount system or similar, this would have freed up the space we needed. More research is needed in this area, but it was a very encouraging experience.&#8221;</p>



<p>Elvery reports that the feedback he received was positive, and the reaction from the Race Ranger Instagram post from the weekend would appear to confirm that fact. </p>



<p>&#8220;Love it, took the guessing game out of how close and when it was time to pull trigger and pass,&#8221; katiesmitzies commented.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t just athletes who provided Elvery with positive feedback from the weekend&#8217;s racing &#8211; the Triathlon New Zealand officials on motorbikes were happy to have the feedback as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;The key learning for me personally was that athletes across the spectrum of experience and ability levels all seemed to be using or at least making an effort to use the lights as intended,&#8221; Elvery wrote. &#8220;I had gone in with a theory that the ‘average’ age grouper, who isn’t particularly serious / super competitive, but who might be more concerned with getting to the finish, having a good time and completing a personal fitness challenge – that they might not be that interested / see the value in having a system to prevent drafting. My thinking was that for this group there wouldn’t be much perceived value in the anti-drafting aspect. But my impression now is that this didn’t appear to be the case. We saw from the roadside that athletes throughout the field were actively using the system as intended.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Race Ranger Future</h2>

<p>Despite the success of the test in Wanaka, we&#8217;re not likely to see Race Ranger units at more events in the near future. The company is in the process of raising more money to pay for more development and, one would assume, more units, in order to build out the viability for age-group usage. We will see the units used at &#8220;a full pro athlete calendar of approximately 40 of the highest level events, much like we did in 2024, with some modest growth,&#8221; Elvery wrote. </p>



<p>The goal remains to scale the system to be able to work with over 3,000 athletes on a single day, though. To do that, Elvery says that Race Ranger will have to reduce &#8220;pain points&#8221; that will arise as the system is scaled to those kind of numbers. Those include:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Making the system really easy to install so &#8220;athletes can fit the devices to their bikes themselves.&#8221; The goal would be for athletes to take the devices back after packet pick-up.</li>



<li>Reducing &#8220;the system to a single (rear) unit.&#8221;</li>



<li>Adding cellular connection in order to provide live tracking and the ability to monitor the units remotely.</li>



<li>&#8220;Completing the connection to the technical officials so that can see which athletes are the &#8216;worst&#8217; offending drafters on the course &#8230;&#8221;</li>



<li>Some of those features might be rolled out within the pro races this year, too.</li>
</ul>



<p>So, while the short answer to my headline question is &#8220;no,&#8221; Race Ranger is getting closer to becoming a realistic possibility for age-group racing. Whether or not racers, and race organizers, are ready to embrace the technology (and presumably the added expense) is another question. It&#8217;s not hard to argue that Race Ranger can make races fairer and safer, so if the costs can be kept down, one would imagine athletes will accept adding a draft-detecting device to their bikes the same way they&#8217;re comfortable throwing a timing chip around their ankles. At least that&#8217;s what Elvery and the crew from Race Ranger are hoping for, anyway.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve made it to February, which naturally means it is school vacation week here at Slowtwitch&#8217;s Tundra Division Outpost. (Primary schools in the northeast generally have both a February and April break, instead of a spring break more aligned with colleges in the March time frame). We have been getting <em>hammered</em> with winter precipitation over the last two weeks, with no fewer than five sustained systems blowing through the region. We&#8217;re just on the back side of number four, which has brought us another foot and change of snow, sleet, graupel, and freezing rain altogether. If this were a typical President&#8217;s Day, we&#8217;d be at our home mountain by now.</p>



<p>But, you see, it isn&#8217;t a typical President&#8217;s Day. As with most storm systems that come through this region, there&#8217;s a lot of wind that immediately follows. This one is particularly special, with sustained winds at 25-40 MPH, and gusts approaching 100 at our typical base of operations. It&#8217;s the windiest I have ever seen post-storm in at least a decade. That much wind plus that much weather means that mountain operations are in full stop &#8212; no lifts, no patrol, no nothing.</p>



<p>But even if this were a slightly more typical start to the holiday week, that&#8217;d just mean lift lines approaching 30-40 minute waits, overcrowded places on the slopes, and&#8230;well&#8230;<em>people</em>. The child, however, loves her ski racing, and if I&#8217;m going to be there anyway, I might as well find a way to enjoy it.</p>



<p>Luckily for me, and for those multisporters who have an adventurous streak amongst them, many ski and snowboard destinations are offering an alternative to riding the lifts up while still getting to enjoy the descent (or even get to download on a lift). It&#8217;s inbounds or resort touring. And there&#8217;s sizable benefit to translate into your summer training that can come with it.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Equipment Decisions: Ski/Splitboard versus Snowshoeing</h2>



<p>Most areas that offer inbounds uphill travel allow you the choice of going up on either alpine based equipment (so you can ski or snowboard down), or to go with snowshoes. Let&#8217;s start with the latter; it&#8217;s by far the least expensive way to try going uphill. A good pair of run-oriented snowshoes, like <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Yukon-Charlies-Run-Ultra-Lite-Snowshoe/dp/B07H7HHVB1?linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=snowshoemagaz-20&amp;linkId=518760ecd808997b255f5df7bf120577&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1"" title="""">these Yukon Charlie&#8217;s Run models</a>, will set you back around $125-$150. Paired up with a decent running shoe, and away you go (and can use them in a variety of conditions). With snowshoeing, you also have the option of either descending on foot, or downloading on a lift. Most opt to come back down on foot, usually choosing the easiest way down the mountain to progress. Still, keep in mind, that can mean some serious pitch in places!</p>



<p>Most uphill travelers in a resort setting are either on skis or a split board (essentially, a snowboard that splits in half for the uphill part, then comes back together for the down). Rentals are typically available at base area shops for the uphill curious. The first question to be answered is &#8220;am I going to use the same boot I do for downhill?&#8221; If the answer is yes, that puts you into an adapter. Be forewarned; even with a touring oriented ski, this is <em>heavy</em>. It&#8217;d be like trying to ride a Tour de France mountain stage on, well, a mountain bike.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll be looking instead at touring boots, which feature two pin-holes in the toe section. That&#8217;s the main attachment point for a tech binding on the uphill part. Binding choice then becomes about whether you want the ski to be as light as possible for the uphill, and sacrificing some downhill performance, or if you would rather have more firepower for the descent and have to haul the weight that comes with it upward. Some bindings, <a href=""https://www.haganskimountaineering.com/collections/atk-parts-and-accessories/products/pure-10-heel-pieces"" title="""">like these</a>, just feature two pin attachments in the heel. Others feature a more traditional clamp-style binding.</p>



<p>I, personally, am in the firm &#8220;less is more&#8221; camp when it comes to the entire system. Seeing as the majority of the time with this system is going to be spent going up the hill, I&#8217;d rather optimize my experience for that. Consequently, the lighter weight system has also forced me to be a better skier, as you have to stay centered over the ski; bad technique gets punished in a hurry. Seeing as I live in the northeast, home to phrases like &#8220;<a href=""https://www.skitheeast.net/collections/mens-shirts/products/element-waffle-crew-vintage-black"" title="""">Born From Ice</a>,&#8221; I also prefer a narrower width ski to help manage the typical boilerplate conditions we experience.</p>

<p>An all-in touring package &#8212; that&#8217;s boots, bindings, skis, and skins &#8212; will run you around $1500. Some touring brands, like Hagan, <a href=""https://www.haganskimountaineering.com/collections/save-on-bundles"" title="""">put together an entire package for you of mated gear</a>. For whatever it&#8217;s worth, Hagan is the brand of gear that I&#8217;ve been using for a few years now, and it was this kind of package that I wound up procuring. I particularly like how versatile <a href=""https://www.haganskimountaineering.com/collections/ultra-series-skis"" title="""">the Ultra series skis</a> have been.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Uphill Access: Still Requires a Pass</h2>



<p>Although earning your turns is free, access to the hill is not necessarily included in your endeavors. Most mountains will require some type of uphill pass, armband, or voucher in order to gain access for the day. This includes agreeing to follow the rules of the mountain on what trails you can ascend on, which side of the trail to go up, and what access hours might exist.</p>



<p>These things are critical to pay attention to, in part because the rules can be entirely different based on the mountain you go to. For instance, <a href=""https://www.stratton.com/the-mountain/safety-and-responsibility/uphill-travel"" title="""">at Stratton</a>, an uphill pass is free and picked up at guest services. Climbers must stay to uphillers&#8217; right (skiers&#8217; left) when climbing, even though the route map makes it look like you should stay left on one of the uphill routes. Conversely, <a href=""https://www.coppercolorado.com/events-activities/winter-activities/uphill-access"" title="""">at Copper in Colorado</a>, an uphill pass is still free (if you have a season pass already); it&#8217;s an armband that must be worn at all times ($5). There are approved daytime and twilight routes, with mandatory descent paths on the twilight ones. And when climbing, it&#8217;s either side of the trail, unless you go up off-hours, at which point you should be in the middle.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" src=""https://www.slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_1886-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67281"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_1886-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_1886-300x225.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_1886-768x576.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_1886-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_1886-2048x1536.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>The key is to make sure that you check in with the mountain you decide to go to and learn what their respective policies and procedures are. I was particularly disappointed at <a href=""https://www.mountsnow.com"" title="""">one of Ivy&#8217;s race host venues earlier this season that there was no climbing permitted on Saturday&#8217;s whatsoever</a>, even to the race venue. My &#8220;discounted&#8221; lift ticket of $104 (after taxes) later&#8230;</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Benefits From Your Hard Work</h2>



<p>Besides the mental benefit of having &#8220;earned your turns&#8221; by climbing, I&#8217;ve found that there&#8217;s been two sizable impacts when it comes to my own training. The first is more mental; simply, by diversifying away from being focused solely on swim / bike / run training during the winter, I find that I attack those sessions with more vigor when the time comes to get more specific with my plan. It&#8217;s hard to want to do a standard run in the conditions we have outside today. It&#8217;s a lot easier to get my touring gear on and go skin instead.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" src=""https://www.slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4478-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67276"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4478-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4478-300x225.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4478-768x576.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4478-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_4478-2048x1536.jpg 2048w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">Despite the frozen beard, I am quite happy.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But the second of these is that it has made me a much better uphill runner. I cannot emphasize this statement enough: I used to be <em>atrocious</em> at running uphill, even when I was approaching Boston Marathon qualifier shape. I don&#8217;t know if it was more of a mental block than a physical performance one, but every time the hills would come, my pace would slow dramatically as compared to others around my time performance. I&#8217;d be trying to make it up on flats and downhills (hint: it doesn&#8217;t work) and, well, the cycle would continue.</p>



<p>That seems to have vanished from my running now that I uphill. I think that boils down to three critical components. First, yes, it&#8217;s mental. But it is rare that you would find any running race hill that exceeds an average 17% grade for two miles (the average pitch for the &#8220;easy&#8221; uphill route at Stratton). You just <em>know</em> you can do a thing now. The second is the specific strength benefit provided going up; the motion, body position, and strength required to travel uphill on skis or snowshoes is akin to that of running. Lastly, there&#8217;s technique that is applicable and learning what makes you faster. Does a lower cadence / longer stride provide more benefit, even in uphill scenarios? Or are you better off with shorter strides and a higher cadence? There&#8217;s a time and a place for each, and learning how to vary it (and how it impacts your times and fatigue levels) goes a long way.</p>



<p>Whatever way you might decide to go uphill &#8212; be safe, stay warm, and have fun.</p>

</div></div>



<p>Let&#8217;s speak in general terms for a moment. If you are riding indoors on a trainer (like a lot of us do), any sort of &#8220;desk or stand&#8221; is needed, or at least preferred. So, with that said, I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb here and say that some kind of &#8220;stand&#8221; is going to be third on my list of things that are most important for indoor training. You probably have a thousand different options of things you can use, so buying something that is made for this specific purpose is not truly needed. But, if you do want something specific to make your life a bit easier than the old music stand or stool you&#8217;re using, you probably have 15 to 20 pretty decent options.</p>



<p>The <strong>KICKR Desk</strong> is one of those products that you don&#8217;t really think you need until you have one. And, If have one, you will NEVER go back, or at least you won&#8217;t want too. The first version was pretty good. Easy to install, nice push buttons that made it super adjustable during a ride, along with a nice, big, wide slip-resistant platform for all your devices, snacks and drinks. It was made out of steel so, unless you left it outside in the rain all the time, chances were it was going to last a really long time. It even had wheels made it easy to move around but, like a true endurance athlete, just moved forward and not side to side. And it was also a single flat platform. It was priced at a somewhat reasonable $299 so, all in all, it was better than most options on the market place.</p>

</div></div>



<p>Fast forward to version 2 of the Kickr Desk. It turns out that Wahoo seems to think they got most of the first version right with the first version, but have made the latest desk even better. Here&#8217;s how:</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Roller Wheels</h2>



<figure class=""wp-block-video alignwide""><video controls src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Slide.mov""></video></figure>



<p>My favorite is the new wheels they have added. To start they have added a fourth wheel for improved adjustments and stability. The front two wheels now rotate 360 degrees, making it easier to move your stand into that corner spot in your garage, basement or stationary bike spot. While it&#8217;s still not as easy as the good old IKEA cart, it&#8217;s also not as annoying trying to control four wheels that want to move in four different directions. (You know what I mean.)</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Bottle Inserts </h2>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bottle-Holders-_1.94.1-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67229"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bottle-Holders-_1.94.1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bottle-Holders-_1.94.1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bottle-Holders-_1.94.1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bottle-Holders-_1.94.1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bottle-Holders-_1.94.1.jpg 2000w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>Two dedicated water bottle holders keep things secure. It would be a really fun statistic to know how many laptops and iPads have had a bottle tip over when someone got a little too aggressive during a trainer sprint, adjusting the position of the desk while riding, or when a child, pet or loved one decided to come say &#8220;Hi&#8221; and knocked into the trainer desk.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Wheel / Towel Hooks </h2>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Wheel-Holders_1.112.1-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67230"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Wheel-Holders_1.112.1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Wheel-Holders_1.112.1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Wheel-Holders_1.112.1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Wheel-Holders_1.112.1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Wheel-Holders_1.112.1.jpg 2000w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>This is my second-favorite add on. The ability to add a wheel or wheels to the side of the cart is pretty clutch. Wahoo does say that these can be used for towels, but all know that towels goes around the handle bars or the head. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Cable Routing</h2>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cable-insert_1.113.1-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67231"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cable-insert_1.113.1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cable-insert_1.113.1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cable-insert_1.113.1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cable-insert_1.113.1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cable-insert_1.113.1.jpg 2000w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>This isn&#8217;t super special, but they do ship six dedicated stickies that can be applied to the side rails for power cables. It really cleans things up and basically saves a trip to go get them.</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Price </h2>



<p>The second version of the desk drops just over 33% of the MSRP, bringing the prices from $299 to $199. This adds to a lot of price cuts that Wahoo has been able to bring to the marketplace as of late as they have figured out how to manufacture produces more efficiently. Which is a good thing for consumers and, besides, if they don&#8217;t, someone else will. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Take Aways </h2>



<p>What don&#8217;t like I like about the new desk? While it&#8217;s still very easy to assemble, the new desk requires some extra steps. It also would have been cool to get locks on the front two wheels. The side thumb buttons you use to adjust platform height are slightly smaller, too. Finally, I have no idea what some of the holes in the platform are for, and there&#8217;s no information about them (yet). </p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""576"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Future-Slots-_1.101.1-1024x576.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67233"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Future-Slots-_1.101.1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Future-Slots-_1.101.1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Future-Slots-_1.101.1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Future-Slots-_1.101.1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Future-Slots-_1.101.1.jpg 2000w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m guessing that eventually Wahoo will offer an add-on for some sort of iPhone/ iPad holder. </p>



<p>But, so far, the desk has been a huge improvement over the already clutch first version. Takes about 10-15 mins to install</p>

<p>A dramatic come-from-behind win. A crash that took out three of the leading teams. A four-way duel for the final two medals. Welcome to the excitement of mixed relay racing. The Mixed Relay Series Abu Dhabi provided lots of excitement today, despite the fact that in the grand scheme of things, there really wasn&#8217;t a lot riding on the result. There&#8217;s literally years before the Olympic qualifying process will begin, and there&#8217;s not much glory to be gained with an early season mixed relay podium. Even Germany, the reigning Olympic mixed relay champions, didn&#8217;t put any of the athletes who won gold for them in Paris on their team. The Germans still managed to come away with the win after a crazy 90 minutes of racing, though. Here&#8217;s how things played out:</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">First Leg</h2>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""682"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0006-1024x682.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67236"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0006-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0006-300x200.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0006-768x511.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0006.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><em>Jolien Vermeylen had a great swim and an even better run to help the Belgian team lead the way into the second leg. Photo: World Triathlon</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Belgium&#8217;s Jolien Vermeylen proved to be the strongest of the 11 athletes who took off for the first leg, managing to move through pretty much the entire field after coming out of the second transition at the back. (After things separated a bit through the swim and the early part of the bike, the entire field bunched together to hit the second transition together.) Initially American Taylor Spivey and Spain&#8217;s Anna Godoy looked like they would finish the run with the Belgian, but a late surge saw Vermeylan get ahead to lead the Spanish team by a second and the Americans by eight. The big shock after the first leg of the race was that Germany&#8217;s Selina Klamt would tag off 43 seconds back. </p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Penalties and a Crash in Leg 2</h2>



<p>As a lead group of five started the bike for the second leg we learned that there were two 10-second &#8220;swim behaviour&#8221; penalties handed out to Portugal (Vasco Vilaca) and Spain (Cantero del Campo). Then, to add to the drama, Switzerland&#8217;s Simon Westermann went down towards the end of the first lap of the bike, taking Great Britain&#8217;s Max Stapley and Vilaca out with him. Del Campo was the quickest of the lead five to get back up, with the Netherlands&#8217; Mitch Kolkman next to get back onto the bike. The crash would end the races for the teams from Switzerland, Great Britain and Portugal, though. </p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""682"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0025-1024x682.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67239"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0025-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0025-300x200.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0025-768x511.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0025.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><em>Photo: World Triathlon</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When Kolkman managed to catch the Spaniard he flew right by and would open up a gap of 11 seconds as he started the run. Team USA&#8217;s John Reed kept his team in third, but only had a few seconds on Italy and Belgium. Those three were well back of the lead, though, and as Cantero flew through the run to pass Kolkman, he would tag off to Miriam Casillas with a lead of nine seconds over the Netherlands. The gap was 17 seconds to Belgium and 30 seconds to the Americans by the end of the second leg. Germany would send off Tanja Neubert 53 seconds down.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Neubert Flies Through the Third Leg</h2>



<p>At the end of the swim it was Casillas and the Netherlands&#8217; Luna de Bruin who set off with a lead of 13 seconds on American Ericka Ackerlund, with Belgium another second down. Neubert jumped on her bike 34 seconds behind and had some company on the bike as she was just a few seconds behind Japan and Ireland. Ackerland and de Bruin worked well together, but couldn&#8217;t make up any time on the pair ahead through the first loop. Neubert powered the third group, which continued to gain time on the leaders, dropping the gap to 25 seconds halfway through the second of two loops on the bike. Neubert&#8217;s group would eventually catch the American and Belgian teams, and as they started the run the gap was down to 10 seconds.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""682"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0070-1024x682.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67241"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0070-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0070-300x200.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0070-768x511.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250216-Abu-Dhabi-Mixed-Relay-MSJ-0070.jpg 1280w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><em>Photo: World Triathlon</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Casillas would pull clear of de Bruin very quickly, but served the 10-second penalty, and suddenly it was Neubert, who had flown through the field, in the lead. Casillas reentered the race in third, but quickly passed Ackerlund to put Spain into second place.</p>



<p>Neubert would continue to pull away, eventually tagging off to Henry Graf with a nine second lead over the American team which was anchored by Olympic silver medalist Morgan Pearson. Italy would hit the water in third, 16 seconds down, with Spain starting the swim another three seconds behind. </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Germany Holds On</h2>



<p>Graf remained well clear during the swim, hitting his first transition 13 seconds ahead of Pearson, with Italy&#8217;s Euan De Nigro and Spain&#8217;s Robert Sanchez 19 seconds down. De Nigro and Sanchez quickly joined Pearson to create a group of three chasing the German. Instead of the group catching up, though, they were joined by the Netherlands&#8217; Gjalt Panjer. Once the group grew to four the charge to try and catch the Germans stopped, and things became more tactical. That meant that by the start of the final 1,600 m leg the fast-running Graf was 35 seconds up.</p>



<p>Graf cruised through the run, leaving four teams to chase the other two medals. De Nigro and Pearson pulled clear almost immediately, making it a race between Italy and the USA for silver. Pearson let the Italian lead the way early, but started to ramp up the effort towards the end of the first lap. Pearson gained 13 seconds on Graf, but was still 22 seconds back with just over 800 m of running to go. </p>



<p>The German broke the tape in 1:32:05, with Pearson bringing the Americans home in 1:32:21 for second and De Nigro helping the Italians round out the podium in 1:32:24. Spain (1:32:38)would take fourth, with the Netherlands finishing fifth in 1:33:01. </p>



<p>Even the Germans were surprised that they were able to pull out the win.</p>



<p>“I knew I had to work on the bike because there were some really fast runners with De Nigro, Pearson and Sanchez coming up, so I wanted to stay away,&#8221; Graf said after the race. &#8220;So I worked really hard on the first lap of the bike already and then I was suffering quite bad on the run and I saw Pearson coming closer, but yeah, I&#8217;m really glad I could keep him off and yeah, I think Tanja did really the MVP performance today. That was crazy. I didn&#8217;t expect to start first and then suddenly she came around the corner.”</p>
