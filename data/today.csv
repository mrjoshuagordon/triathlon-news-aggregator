The Belgian star will go into the T100 Singapore as favourite after being crowned the T100 World Champion last year, but can expect stiff competition everywhere The post Marten van Riel leads all-star field T100 Singapore appeared first on Triathlon Today .",https://tri-today.com/rss,"<p>Marten Van Riel will lead an all-star cast in Singapore after the PTO announced the contracted male athletes who will toe the line on Sunday 5 April for the first T100 race of the season.</p>



<p>The Belgian star will go into the T100 Singapore as favourite after being crowned the T100 World Champion last year, but can expect stiff competition everywhere he looks along the start line at the stunning Marina Bay swim course.</p>



<p>Especially his old Olympic adversary Hayden Wilde, who is relishing the opportunity to step up in distance and take him on in the T100 series for the first time.</p>



<p>“The thing I’m looking forward to about racing the T100 series is probably being strong in all three disciplines,” said the New Zealander, who won silver at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. “So obviously the 20 meter non-drafting rule is great, being strong on the 18km run and then obviously, a few of the athletes will try to get rid of me on the swim.”</p>



<p>“I’m excited to race Marten [Van Riel]. We’ve had some duels over the last few years in the short course, but I know that his forte is probably this long course stuff. He’s gonna be super aggressive, so I’m looking forward to setting up on the line and giving him a bit of a rustle tussle throughout the season.”</p>



<p>But this is far from a two triathlete race. Defending Singapore T100 Triathlon champion, Dutchman Youri Keulen, who claimed his first win on the series here last year in dramatic fashion – when he collapsed after breaking the tape – is looking forward to defending his title: “I’m really looking forward to coming back to Singapore. It’s a place that is close to my heart and I have good memories from.  I know the T100 series this year is more competitive and will be stronger in every discipline, so I don’t want to leave any stone unturned in my preparation. I’m adding more heat sessions and other different sessions to ensure I’m ready. I know I need to bring my A game. But I’d love to return and shake everyone’s hand after the finish. Because I missed that last year.”</p>



<p>Van Riel’s compatriot Jelle Geens is a dark horse for the world title in many people’s eyes having been the only person to beat him last term, as a Wildcard. Having earned a full contract for 2025, Geens will be looking to put down an early marker in the Lion City.</p>



<p>Geens has already ruffled a few American feathers by questioning the Hot Shot credentials of Morgan Pearson. Unsurprisingly, Pearson has singled out Geens as someone he’s looking forward to taking on. He has also highlighted that a winner in Singapore could come from anywhere.</p>



<p>“The T100 series is a race around the world at the highest level of competition and that’s something that I’m extremely attracted to,” explained Pearson. “Standing on the starting line and looking left and looking to the right and thinking, if I win this race, I’m basically the best in the world today. I just love that feeling.”</p>



<p>“I’m also excited to race Jelle Geens. We’ve got that beef, everyone wants to see it, I guess. He’s a great athlete…but I think he’s underestimated me.”</p>



<p>Returning from a hugely impressive second place in the overall 2024 series is another Kiwi, Kyle Smith, who has been vocal about his determination to make it to the top step in a T100 race very soon.  Not forgetting American fan favourite Sam Long, who dramatically went from last out of the water to second place in 2024 despite the hot and humid conditions in Singapore and will surely also be eyeing his first T100 win.</p>



<p>The eighteen contracted T100 men racing are listed below:</p>



<p>Morgan Pearson (USA)</p>



<p>Marten Van Riel (BEL)</p>



<p>Kyle Smith (NZL)</p>



<p>Jelle Geens (BEL)</p>



<p>Sam Long (USA)</p>

The T1 Indoor Triathlon World Cup Lievin start list has been revealed.</p>
<p>Headliners Paris Olympic gold medallist Cassandre Beaugrand and silver medallist Hayden Wilde have been confirmed to compete at the event that sees athletes swim in a pool, then ride and run on an indoor oval track. The &#8220;10 minute tri&#8221; as it has been dubbed due to its short distance covering a 200 metre swim, 2.8 kilometre bike and 1 kilometre run, takes place March 22 in France.</p>
<h2>Beaugrand brings record-setting speed</h2>
<p>Beaugrand just last month set a national French record in her country with a blazing 5km road race time of 14:53. She was also the overall winner of the WTC Series. Wilde was the runner up in December at the Ironman 70.3 World Championships in his homeland, New Zealand, after winning the WTCS Grand Final race and overall Supertri winner. He is currently ranked number one with World Triathlon.</p>

<p>Wilde is coming off a recent win at the WTCS opener in Abu Dhabi last month. This will be Beaugrand&#8217;s first triathlon this year, after changing coaches and moving to Spain following the Paris Olympics.</p>
<h2>Wilde will have to fight for the win</h2>
<p>As fast and competitive as Wilde and Beaugrand are, they aren&#8217;t shoe-ins. Paris Olympic bronze medallist Leo Bergere from France will bring some heat to the men&#8217;s category, as will fellow countryman Dorian Coninx. The Brits are bringing a strong contingent with Sam Dickinson, Harry Leleu, Jack Willis, Hamish Reilly and Ben Dijkstra.</p>
<p>Certain to keep Beaugrand up on her toes will be Frenchwoman Emma Lombardi and Germans Nina Eim and Laura Lindemann. Lombardi was a challenge for Beaugrand at the Olympics and the Germans recently finished on the podium at WTCS Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>The British women set to challenge the others include Lara Atkinson, Isabella Hayes and Annabel Morton.</p>
<p>Beaugrand&#8217;s biggest competition could be Lindemann, who won the race last year when it was the Lieven Indoor World Cup. The upcoming race is a relaunch, as the T1 Indoor Triathlon World Cup, in partnership with the Professional Triathlete Organization, World Triathlon and the Lieven Triathlon Club.</p>

<h2>Indoor racing gaining ground</h2>
<p>The event will roll out in heats, with 12 athletes in each competing for the semi-finals and eventual final showdown. A total of 120 elite men and women have been confirmed to race.</p>
<p>Hosted by the Lievin Triathlon Club, which brought the Indoor World Cup to triathlon racing, it has partnered with the Professional Triathlete Organization (PTO) and World Triathlon to put on the inaugural T1 event.</p>
<p>In April, a similar fast-paced indoor race is set for London. The supertri E promises to draw top athletes to the London Aquatics Centre on the 5th for another round of indoor racing. As the indoor scene heats up and expands, supertri E is returning bigger and better this year. It has added the inclusion of age group athletes from select clubs in the London area, in the hopes of growing the alternative, spectator and beginner-friendly racing style.</p>

<p>When fitting cyclists, I often hear, <em>“I want a position that allows me to put out the most power.”</em> While some fits might result in dramatic wattage gains, these are usually seen when a rider&#8217;s initial position was highly restrictive. Subtle changes—like adjusting saddle height by a few millimeters—won’t magically add 20 watts.</p>

A reliable smart watch with relevant data tracking can help your session go smoother, keep you motivated and provide useful feedback.</p>
<p>One of the first considerations is whether or not your current smart watch is user friendly in the pool. Some have better functionality and precision than others when it comes to pool and open water swimming. Accurate lap counts and the ability to track non-swimming set like kicking using a drill setting will allow you to count the length a smart watch can&#8217;t inherently recognize. This ensures all your effort is reflected in the data and training software.</p>
<p>Screen size is also important as is backlighting, especially in open water swim when you may be floating around far out in choppy water trying to read your watch face. In this case, GPS is also important for tracking distance when you can&#8217;t rely on counting lengths of the pool.</p>

<h2>Dial in your swim sessions with the right data</h2>
<p>Feedback such as stroke rate and pacing offers valuable insight into your technique and racing skills. If your stroke rate is low during sprint intervals the watch has helped you identify an area you can work on to improve speed. If the data shows uneven pacing on a longer tempo set than you know you need to work on managing effort more evenly.</p>
<p>There are a lot of choices on the market and it can be a challenge to wade through all the options. We review three popular and effective models for 2025 that can help you make waves in your swim training this year.</p>
<h3>Garmin Swim 2</h3>
<p>This watch is a great option if you are looking to add a watch just for swimming. Maybe you already have an high-end watch that you use for running and cycling, and the addition of a dedicated, swim-specific watch is all you need to complete your set.</p>
<p>The Swim 2 is a standout in that it has wrist-based heart rate. Most triathlon watches don&#8217;t have a heart rate function while swimming, unless you wear a waterproof chest strap, which adds about $150-200 to your overall cost. The wrist-based function works in both the pool and open water modes. Having accurate heart rate zones for swimming is a valuable tool when setting targets for swim sets to ensure you are working hard enough on the fast-paced sets and keeping the easy sets easy.</p>
<p>The latest 2025 model records lengths, distance, pace, stroke count and type, SWOLF and has a built-in GPS for much less than a multisport watch at C$349.99.</p>

<h3>Suunto Race S</h3>
<p>This model has multisport functions on top of its impressive swim functionality. It has a touchscreen that displays distance, stroke rate, count and type, and pace. It standouts with its automatic intervals in the pool and its heart rate variability (HRV) function. The HRV component helps inform sleep and recovery and reports on training readiness. This can help you adjust intensity appropriately during your swim session.</p>
<p>Knowing if you are fresh for all out sprints or should pivot to longer tempo sets will help set you up for a quality session that you can execute well and adapt optimal from. In a lightweight durable titanium, this watch will set you back C$649.</p>
<h3>Polar Vantage V3</h3>
<p>The AMOLED screen is ideal for screen viewing, especially in lower light such as when you are out on the open water on a cloudy day. It sports all the usual swim functionalities of most watches, but standouts with one unique feature.</p>
<p>This watch is able to detect various swim stroke in the pool. It knows the difference between freestyle and breaststroke. This adds a layer of accuracy to your swim data as pacing is now associated with different strokes instead of lumping paces from all strokes together. Now when you review your data you can see stroke-specific pacing, allowing you to more easily set targets for sets other than your standard freestyle workouts.</p>

<p>The GPS function for open water swimming is accurate and reliable. Beyond its standout swim functionality, the watch measures skin temperature, which is a unique function that can help inform how heat impacts your sessions. That data can help design sessions more appropriately around heat and when doing heat specific training.</p>
<p>All the other typical functions of a multisport watch are present. It comes in at a higher price point for C$899.99.</p>
<h2>Make the best use of your time in the pool</h2>
<p>Depending what you want to measure and target specifically in swim training, one of these watches will deliver. Having a tool that is simple and stress-free when using in water reduces the normal anxiety that can often accompany any swim session.</p>
<p>Targeted data that will help you or your coach design a more specific swim training program that can ensure you are using your time in the pool effectively and working on the elements that will give you the biggest gains.</p>

<h2>British Columbia</h2>
<p>If you are on the other end of the country, or taking a trip out west this summer, there are plenty of chances to qualify in BC. Most of the 10 races with qualifying spots only have one per age group, with two exceptions.</p>
<p>The events with three spots are the Apple Triathlon in Kelowna, host of the National Age Group Championships, August 9-10. It has spots in the sprint and standard triathlon, and standard aquabike . The other is the inaugural PTO T100 Vancouver race with spots in the long distance triathlon, June 13-15.</p>
<p>Other action is going down at the Oliver Triathlon with the sprint triathlon, long distance triathlon, long distance aquabike, and mixed relay on June 7-8. The same weekend, the Squamish Triathlon has spots in its cross triathlon.</p>
<p>The Peach Classic in Penticton will be awarding spots in the sprint and standard triathlon, and standard aquabike on July 20. Off the mainland in Victoria, athletes can earn a spot at the Elk Lake Triathlon in the standard aquathlon and standard duathlon, August 3.</p>

<h2>Other qualifying criteria</h2>
<p>Spots awarded to top finishers who don&#8217;t take their spot roll down to the next athlete, but only to the eighth spot. If you did not finish in the top eighth in your age group you are not eligible to take a roll down spot.</p>
<p>To be considered for any spot you must first fill out an Expression of Interest (EOI) and submit it before the race. Generally, EOIs open three weeks prior to race day. EOI forms and other information can be found on the Triathlon Canada website.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>American Taylor Knibb, the 2024 T100 World Champion, will line up for her first ever T100 race in the Lion City and renew her rivalry with Australian Ashleigh Gentle, who was the runner up in the inaugural series but has won both the PTO’s 100km races in Singapore, proving herself highly adept in hot and humid conditions.</p>



<p>Speaking about her approach for the new season, Gentle has underlined the importance of her mental preparation, saying: “I’m telling myself that I can be the T100 World Champion. That’s the mentality I have to have and I believe it will give me the best chance – along with giving everything I have in training, which of course I feel like I always have.”</p>



<p>“I switched coaches at the middle of last year. So going into Singapore this year will be different preparation for me and I’m excited to see if that’s going to work out. I definitely feel good about how training’s going. It’s a slog in Queensland right now [due to the hot weather], but I know that that’s really good preparation for the sauna that is Singapore.”</p>



<p>Swiss Olympic star Julie Derron completes the top ranked trio. Derron won silver at the Paris 2024 Games last summer and showed how much of a threat she will be by delivering standout performances in Ibiza, Lake Las Vegas and Dubai last term, where she finished in second place.</p>



<p>Also on the start line is Tokyo 2021 Olympic champion Flora Duffy, who after a full winter training on a TT bike is sure to be in contention. Paris 2024 Olympic relay silver medalist Taylor Spivey will be in a similar position and proved how fast she can be in the swim and run during the second half of last year. British breakthrough star Lucy Byram came sixth overall on the T100 Tour last year and is looking to improve. 2023 Ironman World Champion, Lucy Charles-Barclay, who came second in Singapore in 2024 after leading deep into the run, will also be a contender.</p>



<p>The full line up of contracted T100 women is listed below:</p>



<ol class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>Taylor Knibb (USA)</li>



<li>Ashleigh Gentle (AUS)</li>

It&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ve made some improvement in your functional threshold power (FTP) in that time. Before you dig in and start ramping up the intensity and duration for another season, it&#8217;s probably time to update your FTP so your training targets are in line with your new fitness level.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to take the (dreaded) FTP test. If you haven&#8217;t already done so, you want to buckle down for the tough test soon so that you aren&#8217;t short changing yourself with your power zones. Setting the appropriate power targets in training will ensure you are pushing to the best of your ability and getting the most out of your training time. There are several indoor trainer sessions used to test your FTP. You can follow one built by your coach or found online, or tap into the tests already loaded into some virtual cycling apps.</p>
<h2>Understanding threshold power</h2>
<p>To understand the tests and how they capture your FTP it&#8217;s important to understand exactly what you are attempting to measure. Your FTP refers to your threshold for the best power you can hold consistently for one hour. That is how it is defined, but generally not how it is executed either in testing, training or racing. Most FTP tests are hacks to avoid putting you through an hour of hell. Once measured, your FTP is used to calculate all your power zones. Each zone can be determined by calculating a specific percentage of that holy grail of numbers.</p>

<p>The term FTP is interchangeable with threshold power and lactate threshold. It&#8217;s easy to get confused, but they are all referring to the same thing. There are several ways to determine if you are working at your threshold power. One is through performing the on-bike test and crunching the numbers, or you can opt to take a blood sample to determine your blood lactate concentration. A third way is to simply get familiar with what it feels like to be working at this effort. Threshold being the line that divides working at an effort that does not initiate lactate build up and an effort that does.</p>
<p>Threshold does not feel like an all-out sprint because it has to be sustainable for one hour, in theory. Generally, if you are working &#8220;hard,&#8221; it is taking much concentration to maintain that effort, and you are struggling to breathe easy or hold a conversation, you are likely there. If you feel the telltale burn, that&#8217;s a good indication you&#8217;ve hit the line.</p>
<h2>Which test is right for you?</h2>
<p>One of the most common FTP tests involves 20 minutes at the hardest, consistent effort you can hold. This is usually done after an even harder five minutes to crush your soul just a little bit before going into the main set. The test is usually done on an indoor trainer, and 95 per cent of the average power produced during the hard 20 minutes is calculated to be your FTP. The first hard five minutes, and the 95 per cent, is to offset the fact that you are only performing 20 minutes instead of the full hour.</p>
<h3>20 Minutes Test</h3>
<p>Warm up: 10 minutes easy</p>
<p>Spin ups: 5 x 20 seconds on 40 seconds easy. Spin ups are done with low resistance at high cadence you get the legs and heart primed for the work ahead.</p>
<p>5 minute pre-test: ride hard for 5 minutes at the best power you can sustain consistently for the entire duration</p>
<p>10 minutes recovery: ride easy and get mentally prepared for the main test</p>
<p>20 minute main test: ride hard for 20 minutes at the best power you can sustain consistently for the entire duration</p>
<p>Cool down: 10 minutes easy</p>
<p>*Calculate your FTP by taking 95 per cent of the average power you produced during the 20 minute main test. Alternately, you can perform 2 x 8 minutes at the best power you can sustain, with 10 minutes easy in between. If you choose this method, calculate the average power by 90 per cent to arrive at your FTP.</p>

<p>Zwift offers a ramp test, which is an alternative to the 20 minutes flat out test. This option is shorter than the classic 20 minute test, which Zwift also offers. The ramp test uses one minute intervals which get progressively harder until you reach your max aerobic power (MAP). Your MAP is used to determine your FTP by multiplying it by 75 per cent. Ramp tests can be easier as they do not require the skill of pacing the 20 hard effort test, which can take several attempts to perfect.</p>
<h3>Zwift&#8217;s Ramp test</h3>
<p>Warm up: 10 minutes easy</p>
<p>Main test: repeat 1 minute intervals starting at 100 watts and increasing by 20 watts on each 1 minute interval. Continue with as many 1 minute intervals as necessary until you reach failure (you may want to start above 100 watts if you know you have a high FTP and you are short on time).</p>
<p>Cool down: 10 minutes easy</p>
<p>*The app will use its algorithm to calculate your FTP based on the watts you achieve on the final interval and how long you held on for.</p>
<h3>Wahoo&#8217;s SYSTM&#8217;s 4DP Full Frontal test</h3>
<p>This test seeks to determine not only your FTP, but also your MAP, max anaerobic power and max neuromuscular power.</p>
<p>Warm up: 10 minutes easy</p>
<p>Main test: 2 x 5 second all out sprints on 5 minutes recovery</p>
<p>1 x 5 minute max power intervals on 5 minutes recovery</p>
<p>20 minute max power interval on 5 minutes recovery</p>
<p>1 minute max power interval on 5 minutes recovery</p>
<p>*The app will use its algorithm to calculate all the values.</p>

<h3>Classic threshold test</h3>
<p>Another trainer or outdoor method is to ride as hard as you can for an hour. This is not a popular method for obvious reasons, unless you are particularly savage.</p>
<p>This test can be accomplished through other means though. If you happen to be racing and holding your best effort for one hour you&#8217;ve got your data without putting yourself through a gruelling test. The same is true with criterium style racing.</p>
<p>Whichever test is most appropriate for you in terms of time, equipment and previous testing experience, there are a few key things to remember. Wear a heart rate (HR) monitor strap, if possible, to collect data for setting HR zones also. Make sure you are rested and ready to perform the test on the day or the results will be less accurate. And always be conscious of the fact that your FTP is slightly different on any given day, depending on current training volume, sleep, nutrition and other life stressors.</p>
<p>Most of all, try to have fun doing any one of these challenging but rewarding test of physical and mental strength.</p>

<p>Later today, March 3rd, you will notice a few changes to the Slowtwitch site. These are changes that we&#8217;ve been working for over a year on, and we&#8217;re pretty proud to launch. </p>



<p>For over two decades, we here at Slowtwitch have endeavored to create a space where fierce, independent story-telling can exist. In a media landscape littered with content that doesn&#8217;t dig beneath the surface, Slowtwitch and its writers have dug trenches. From Dan&#8217;s innovations and expertise in bike fit to Jordan&#8217;s experiences as a pro triathlete to my run business background (and the countless others who have graced our digital pages), we&#8217;ve been able to deliver unique content unlike any other in endurance sports. And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re lucky to have so many of you join us either on the home page or in the Slowtwitch Forums &#8212; either as an active community member or as a reader. For 23 plus years this site has solely existed because of readers, partners, and contributors. It&#8217;s been a labor of love by all.</p>



<p>To keep things moving forward and heading in the right direction we&#8217;re now taking the next step in our journey. We&#8217;re proud to announce Slowtwitch+ &#8212; a premium content experience that will allow us to go deeper than ever before.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">What Slowtwitch+ is Not</h2>



<p>We aren&#8217;t cutting off what you the reader have generally have had for free for all this time. This is not a traditional paywall. Understanding that our business model needed to adapt to fit the current media landscape, we knew we needed to balance our financial needs and not having a hard line in the sand. Slowtwitch+ is our way of doing that. It&#8217;s important for us to remain as &#8220;free&#8221; as possible. </p>



<p>Unlike other sites that only allow for a few free articles, we will continue to have many articles that are free for anyone to read. These articles will include articles about our partners, articles that we deem important for our community to read, and general news articles. In other words, it&#8217;s much of what our community has come to expect on this site. When it comes to our forum, it&#8217;s much the same &#8212; things will not change much for non-plus users. Perhaps the biggest change is that a few categories of our forum will become only open to Slowtwitch+ members.</p>



<p>In other words: if you decide that Slowtwitch+ isn&#8217;t for you, great! Your user experience doesn&#8217;t really change as most of our traditionally produced content will remain free.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Who and What Slowtwitch + is For</h2>



<p>We’ve designed Slowtwitch+ for the serious reader and active forum user. We have hundreds of thousands of unique users that come to the site every month. We have the need for more content every day. Our users are looking for more, and we want to give it to them. Slowtwitch+ is a membership experience for both the front-page and forum that will give those users who are searching for more. </p>



<p>Members will receive all of the content that we produce. You&#8217;ll hear from industry experts to very talented community members, all share their truths and stories here. Slowtwitch+ members also  receive a banner ad-free experience. The removal of ads will also allow for users to have a wider, more visual story experience as removing ads will allow for more usable space within the desktop view. Membership will unlock benefits in our forum as well. Slowtwitch+ members will be identified with a ST+ icon, not dissimilar to a verified badge on other social media platforms. It helps build trust within our community as the icon will help denote our most serious and active users. As an example, it should give a better experience for buying and selling within the classifieds. </p>



<p>Members will have more input on what they want to get from our emails &#8212; you&#8217;ll be able to select the frequency and type of content you&#8217;ll receive, such as our traditional Weekly Update, Breaking News newsletters, and more. Our podcast is coming back and we are committed to it weekly but it will also be a &#8220;+&#8221; feature. And, for the first time, we&#8217;re going physical media: Slowtwitch+ members will receive Slowtwitch Press our print issue four times per year. The first of these will ship later this spring.</p>



<p>So, in summary:</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">
<li>No banner ads</li>



<li>Quarterly issues of the new Slowtwitch Press</li>



<li>Access to more than 90 articles/month</li>



<li>Access to our weekly podcast</li>



<li>Exclusive deals in our shop</li>



<li>Exclusive deals from Slowtwitch partners</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, Slowtwitch+ will allow us to continue to provide in-depth reporting across the multisport world, without having to relay solely on endemic brands and partners to do all the heavy lifting. From product reviews to interviews to the politics of race permitting to worldwide event coverage, Slowtwitch+ unlocks our ability to chase stories, wherever they may go. We&#8217;re able to have more contributors than ever join our team to write these stories. </p>



<p>Ultimately, Slowtwitch+ is our way of ensuring that Slowtwitch remains the home of independent story-telling and community hosting that we&#8217;ve aspired to be for the last 23 years. We hope you&#8217;ll join us for the ride. </p>

Skipper answered the lingering question about his racing readiness after a rough season last year that forced an early end to racing following a health scare.</p>
<p>The British athlete raced under a cloud of doubt but emerged second in Taupo, ceding only to winner Mike Phillips. Jack Moody rounded out the podium in third. Phillips&#8217; win made for his third consecutive one in his home country, while fellow Kiwi runner up Moody added to his previous podiums in 2019 and 2023.</p>
<p>Skipper didn&#8217;t make it out of the water with the front pack but lead the chasers after exiting about three and a half minutes back in the thirteenth place. By the halfway mark on the bike the chase group was about three minutes behind the lead group of seven that included Phillips and Moody. The lead group started to splinter around 120km with Moody dropping back and Phillips still up front.</p>

<h2>Skipper and Moody work together on the bike</h2>
<p>Skipper and Moody worked well together to make gains on the lead pack but Phillips got away making a break for it. The breakaway gave Phillips almost a minutes and 40s seconds on the rest of the field going into T2. He held strong for the first half of the marathon, but then Moody found another gear and was closing the gap. It was a gap that was eventually overtaken by Skipper, who also couldn&#8217;t catch Phillips at the front but finished in second about three minutes behind. Moody held onto third after his initial surge to overtake Phillips fizzled.</p>
<p>Skipper&#8217;s performance was not only a triumph after dropping out of Ironman Lake Placid last year, after which he publicly announced he would be taking a break, but on Saturday he also broke Andrew Staykowicz&#8217;s bike course record. Skipper&#8217;s own course record, set in 2020, was also broken on the day by Phillips. The top seven athletes all went sub eight hours.</p>

<h2>McCauley falls back on the run</h2>
<p>On the women&#8217;s side, American Jocelyn McCauley came out of the water about two minutes back, but quickly took the lead on the bike. She was looking to take a third consecutive win but was overtaken by Switzerland&#8217;s Nina Derron on the run, who was then overtaken by Australia&#8217;s Regan Hollioake. Hollioake held on to the lead for the rest of the race while McCauley went back and forth with Derron, ultimately holding on to second by the finish. Derron retained her place finishing in third. McCauley had dominated on the bike and a third win looked possible, but despite a six minute leadheading out on the run her lead diminished quickly and she was unable to recoup the loss.</p>
<p>Another favourite going in was Britain&#8217;s Fenella Langridge. She came out of the water in second but struggles on the bike lead her to drop out. Langridge was also attempting a comeback like Skipper after a rough season last year.</p>
<p>The official Ironman Pro Series kicks off this month with Ironman 70.3 Geelong on March 23 and Ironman South Africa African Championship on March 30.</p>

<p>The city is no stranger to hosting world sporting events. It is well-known for its world class Valencia Marathon, but it will be the first time it is hosting the two triathlon events. The PTO is expecting 20 male and female elites on the start line for the 100km race taking place around the La Marina de Valencia on the Balearic Sea.</p>
<h2>Host city ready for the challenge</h2>
<p>It is also the first time a city has been chosen to host both a T100 and World Cup race on the same weekend in the same location. World Triathlon Elected President, Antonio F. Arimany touted the joint weekend as a great example of how the two organizations are partnering to bring more excitement and opportunities to the sport.</p>

<p>&#8220;By merging our efforts with PTO and the Spanish Federation, and delivering the T1oo and the World Cup events in Valencia on the same weekend, we are proving once again the greatness of the partnership, and it also offers numerous benefits, including amplifying the excitement surrounding the races,&#8221; said Arimany.</p>
<p>&#8220;It allows participants, spectators, and local communities to experience a vibrant celebration of triathlon, creating a more inclusive environment where fans can witness world-class performances and participate in mass participation events. Additionally, the collaboration enhances logistical efficiencies and maximizes resources, ensuring a seamless and high-quality experience for everyone involved,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>History of great racing in Valencia</h2>
<p>The new location replaces the T100 in Ibiza, Spain. The Valencia World Cup has been on the calendar since 2020, drawing big names like Olympic medallists Gwen Jorgensen, Vincent Luis, Alistair Brownlee, Beth Potter, Kristian Blummenfelt and Lisa Terstch. The start line this year for the T100 is shaping up to be another battle with top athletes Hayden Wilde, Jason West, Jelle Geens, Leo Bergere, Antonio Benito Lopez and Marten Van Riel, to name only a few of the 20 pro males. On the women&#8217;s side, Ashleigh Gentle, Caroline Pohle, Ellie Salthouse, Emma Pallant-Brown, Els Visser and Flora Duffy has been confirmed, among the list of 20 of the sport&#8217;s top women.</p>
<p>To date no start list has been released for the World Cup races.</p>

<p>President of the Spanish Triathlon Federation, Jose Hidalgo, welcomed the challenge adding the T100 to the weekend events.</p>
<p>&#8220;T100 wanted to continue in Spain, as it is a key country in the world of triathlon and we also want to live up tot he expectations,&#8221; said Hidalgo. &#8220;We are looking forward to the first competition in which both entities, World Triathlon and T100, will coexist.&#8221;</p>
<p>The weekend festival also adds new distances for age group athletes, who will get a chance to compete over the weekend in spring and super sprint distances.</p>

<p>Ever since the Professional Triathletes Organisation and World Triathlon signed a partnership deal (August, 2023 &#8211; <a href=""https://slowtwitch.com/news/pto-world-triathlon-team-up-for-world-championship-tour/"" title="""">here&#8217;s Ryan&#8217;s story on the announcement</a>), triathlon fans have wondered when we might see the two organizations co-host an event. That question got answered today &#8211; welcome to the Valencia T100.</p>



<p>The new event, which replaces the T100 race in Ibiza, will be held at the same venue and on the same weekend as the World Triathlon Cup Valencia.  </p>



<p>“By merging our efforts with PTO and the Spanish Federation, and delivering the T100<strong><em> </em></strong>and the World Cup events in Valencia on the same weekend, we are proving once again the greatness of the partnership, and it also offers numerous benefits, including amplifying the excitement surrounding the races,&#8221; said Antonio F. Arimany, World Triathlon Elected President. &#8220;It allows participants, spectators, and local communities to experience a vibrant celebration of triathlon, creating a more inclusive environment where fans can witness world-class performances and participate in mass participation events. Additionally, the collaboration enhances logistical efficiencies and maximizes resources, ensuring a seamless and high-quality experience for everyone involved.”</p>



<p>The Valencia event won&#8217;t host an age-group 100 km race, but &#8220;there will be a number of mass participation events throughout the weekend, including sprint and super sprint distances,&#8221; according to today&#8217;s release.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we learned that the PTO had <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/media-releases/pto-partnership-with-world-triathlon-and-lievin-triathlon-for-indoor-world-cup/"" title="""">partnered with the Lievin Triathlon World Cup</a>. While much of the focus on the PTO side of things is &#8220;to elevate the event on a broadcast perspective,&#8221; according to PTO CEO Sam Renouf, the PTO will have staff on the ground to help run the race in France at the end of the month. </p>



<p>Today&#8217;s announcement almost fills out the dates and venues for this year&#8217;s T100 Series &#8211; the Lake Las Vegas date remains up in the air (one assumes it&#8217;ll be some time in October). Here&#8217;s the schedule so far:</p>

Although Styles is more often spotted running in the cities where he performs, it was not known that he was training for, let alone participating in a marathon.</p>



<p>Styles was a member of the British boy band One Direction for many years. In 2017, he released his first solo album. In the following years, he scored hits with songs such as As It Was, Watermelon Sugar and What Makes You Beautiful.</p>

<p>During the swim, however, it was other women who led the field &#8211; not entirely surprisingly: Alanis Siffert and Fenella Langridge took 48:24 minutes for the 3.8 kilometers and then led the field. At 2:18 minutes, Jocelyn McCauley then followed in third and, another minute behind, Hollioake, Gabrielle Lumkes and Nina Derron followed in a chasing group.</p>



<p>On the bike, it quickly became apparent that Langridge could not keep up with Siffert, so the Swiss went solo almost immediately into the lead. Yet that didn&#8217;t last long either, as McCauley had already turned her deficit into a fourteen-second lead within thirty kilometers. In the kilometers that followed, that lead built to about a minute and McCauley was chased by a group with Hollioake, Derron and Siffert.</p>



<p>From that point on, it became a lonely bike ride for McCauley, as her lead continued to grow and until T2 she would not see anyone again. There she hung her bike in the racks with a lead of 5:41 minutes over Derron and Hollioake, who were still riding together, while the gap of the fourth woman, at that time Lumkes, had increased to almost nineteen minutes.</p>



<p>During the marathon, it was quickly apparent that McCauley would have a tough time against a fast running Derron and Hollioake. For her part, Derron first grabbed a small lead over Hollioake, but both women saw their gap to McCauley decrease by minutes. After about 12 kilometers, Derron took over the lead in the race, directly followed by McCauley, while Hollioake followed by a minute and a half.</p>



<p>Yet crucial kilometers then followed, as halfway through, Hollioake in turn had taken over the lead and from then on the run became a solo ride to victory. She won the race in 8:51:30. McCauley, who managed to resist Derron&#8217;s attack, finished second in 8:56:52. Derron finished third in 8:57:48.</p>

<p>After setting the world&#8217;s fastest women&#8217;s age-group time at IRONMAN Western Australia in 2023, Australia&#8217;s Regan Hollioake took fourth in her first pro race in Taupo last year. She followed that up with wins at IRONMAN Australia and IRONMAN Malaysia, adding a fifth at IRONMAN Lake Placid to her resume as well during what turned out to be an impressive professional rookie year.&nbsp;Today she built on that resume, running her way to the win at IRONMAN New Zealand in Taupo.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the best races in the world,&#8221; the champ said of Taupo after her big win. &#8220;It&#8217;s so incredible. To do my first pro race here last year and to come back this year and win is just amazing.&#8221; </p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Siffert Leads the Way, Then it&#8217;s McCauley&#8217;s Turn</h2>



<p>Switzerland&#8217;s Alanis Siffert was first out of the water, with Brit Fenella Langridge three seconds back. Then it was two-time Taupo champion, American Jocelyn McCauley, who was next to run to transition, 2:18 behind, with Hollioake another 62 seconds behind in fourth.</p>



<p>Once out on the bike Langridge couldn&#8217;t stay with the Swiss swim leader, with McCauley quickly moving into second. By 30 km the American was in the lead &#8211; by the halfway point of the ride she was almost two minutes up on another Swiss athlete, Nina Derron. Hollioke was just a couple of seconds behind the Swiss athlete, and the two managed to keep the gap at about 2:30 through 137 km of riding. McCauley was able to use the long, gradual uphill (and headwind) on the second half of the bike loop to increase her lead to almost six minutes by the end of the ride, though. </p>



<p>Through the first 11 km of the run McCauley was able to hold off Derron&#8217;s charge for the front, but within a few km the Swiss athlete had surged into the lead, with Hollioake still over 90-seconds behind. By the halfway point, though, the Aussie had made her move and was in the lead, 38 seconds ahead of Derron, with McCauley just another nine seconds behind.</p>



<p>From there Hollioake was unstoppable, cruising through a 3:06:02 marathon to finish in 8:51:30. McCauley kept the pressure on Derron and would re-take second place with 10 km to go. Even though Derron ran just under five minutes faster than the American (3:12:42 vs 3:17:22), over the final 10 km the American ran almost a minute faster, getting her to the line in 8:56:52 for second, with Derron taking third in 8:57:48.

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a great swim, but Nina and I worked together (legally) on the bike and rode really strongly,&#8221; Hollioake said after the race. &#8220;I came off the bike feeling good, so I knew I could run strong. It was a fairly consistent day all around.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew the girls were running really hard up front initially, and doing an IRONMAN, it really doesn&#8217;t start until 20 km,&#8221; Hollioake continued. &#8220;I&#8217;m really confident in my ability to hold strong, so I knew at 20 km that if I could hold it together I had a good chance of winning.&#8221;</p>

He was not yet first out The post Mike Phillips in new course record to win Ironman New Zealand appeared first on Triathlon Today .",https://tri-today.com/rss,"<p>It&#8217;s still early in the season, but Mike Phillips&#8217; definitely is in good shape already. In his home country, he just won Ironman New Zealand, and he did so in a new course record: 7:45:47.</p>



<p>For Phillips, it was a day where he was at the front all day. He was not yet first out of the water, but he was in the leading group that came out of the water after 47:49 minutes, led by Benjamin Zorgnotti. On the bike, a leading group of seven formed, including, in addition to Zorgnotti and Phillips, Pim van Diemen, Arnaud Guilloux, Mikel Ugarte Ramos, Tim van Berkel and Jack Moody.</p>



<p>On the bike, the pace was high &#8211; led mainly by Dutchman Van Diemen &#8211; yet the break remained intact for about a hundred kilometers. Only shortly thereafter did the first differences begin to emerge and Guilloux and Moody were the first two athletes to be dropped.</p>



<p>Only in the last thirty kilometers did some more differences emerge; when Phillips pushed it a little bit more, it allowed him to start the marathon with a lead of 1:39 minutes over Van Berkel, Moody and Van Diemen. Behind Van Diemen, Joe Skipper followed in fifth position at 2:20 minutes and Zorgnotti in sixth at 2:28 minutes. By then the gap to Ugarte Ramos had grown to nearly seven minutes.</p>



<p>During the marathon, Phillips&#8217; lead was no longer in danger anywhere. The Kiwi courageously held on and thanks to a run time of 2:40:52, he crossed the line as the winner in a course record of 7:45:47. Skipper eventually finished second in 7:48:47 and Moody third in 7:49:12.</p>

<p>Course knowledge proved key at IRONMAN New Zealand today as Mike Phillips knew exactly the right time to make his move on the bike, opening up the winning gap as he headed into T2. The Kiwi star never looked back on his way to his third full-distance title in Taupo, setting a new course record in the process.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Lead Pack Swim and Bike</h2>



<p>Benjamin Zorgnotti (born in France, but representing French Polynesia) led a group of eight out of the water. In that group you had pre-race-favourites Phillips, his countryman Jack Moody and Aussie Tim Van Berkel, while course-record holder (7:54:17 in 2020), Great Britain&#8217;s Joe Skipper, hit dry land 3:30 back.</p>



<p>The lead group was quickly trimmed to seven as Kiwi Matt Kerr was dropped early in the bike. By the time the group hit the halfway point they remained 3:53 ahead of Skipper. Over the second half of the ride France&#8217;s Arnaud Guilloux got dropped from the group, then Spain&#8217;s Mikel Ugarte Ramos found himself unable to keep up. As Skipper was finally getting close to the leaders, Phillips made a push over the final 20 km of the ride.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess I know this course pretty well,&#8221; Phillips said after the race. &#8220;I know the return leg on the bike is pretty tough &#8211; headwind and slightly uphill. I tried to save a bit of energy for that and, as we were coming up the hill, I wasn&#8217;t really trying to pull away, I was just trying to keep the gap to the likes of Joe Skipper. Then I turned around and no one was there. I was happy to take a couple-of-minute lead starting the run.&#8221;</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t quite two minutes, but it was close &#8211; Phillips hit transition 1:39 up on Van Berkel, 1:41 ahead of Moody, 1:44 ahead of Pim Van Diemen (NED), with Skipper finishing the bike 2:20 back, eight seconds up on Zorgnotti. </p>



<p>Phillips, who holds the run course record in Taupo (2:40:04), lost a bit of ground to Moody through the first half of the run, but was still 1:20 ahead with 21 km to go. At that point Skipper remained 2:43 behind, with Zorgnotti just over four minutes back and Van Berkel sitting around five minutes behind the lead. </p>



<p>&#8220;Jack&#8217;s a phenomenal runner, so I had to keep my wits about me,&#8221; Phillips said of the marathon. &#8220;I pushed the pace during the first half just to keep the gap &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t too keen on running side by side with him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Phillips hung tough over the second half of the run and was able to hold his ground to take the win in 7:45:47 after a 2:40:52 marathon, shattering Skipper&#8217;s course record by over eight minutes. The drama came for the runner-up spot, though, as Skipper made up a deficit of exactly a minute to pass Moody in the final 5 km to take second in 7:48:47. The Brit would run the marathon exactly one second slower than Phillips. Moody would hang on for the final spot on the podium with his 7:49:12 finish (2:42:15 marathon).</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our hometown IRONMAN,&#8221; Phillips said when asked what it means to have taken a third title. &#8220;The support here for the locals is crazy. The community gets behind us so strongly &#8211; there are so many local volunteers. To win at home in New Zealand is absolutely amazing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The course here is pretty tough,&#8221; Phillips said when asked what enabled his success in Taupo. &#8220;We have rough roads here, which makes the bike pretty hard. I think a lot of the international athletes struggle a wee bit with that. It&#8217;s also in our summer time, which makes it easier for us to prepare and we don&#8217;t have to travel too far, which all works in the Kiwi&#8217;s favour, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<p>Phillips has registered for IRONMAN South Africa in a month, and as long as he recovers well over the next week or so that will be his next race. He&#8217;ll follow that up with the IRONMAN Asia-Pacific Championship in Cairns, where he finished third last year. All that&#8217;s with the goal of having a better day in Nice than he did in 2023 &#8211; that year he would end up dropping out.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited to go back there and do a bit better than I did last time,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2>Fan favourite Joe Skipper is back</h2>
<p>Fans are in for a treat with Great Britain&#8217;s Joe Skipper in the mix. Skipper has had a tough few season lately. It will be the first glimpse into how he is doing since a set back last year. Following a few disappointing results, he dropped out of 2024 Ironman Lake Placid and publicly announced we was taking some time off and getting some blood work done. He opted out of competing for a Kona spot last year as a result.</p>
<p>Following his announcement to drop out of Lake Placid he shared a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be taking some time off now. I&#8217;m going to get some blood tests done to see if there&#8217;s anything up with me as I&#8217;ve been so inconsistent and rarely feel like my normal self in races. I don&#8217;t know when I will race again as I&#8217;m going to just concentrate on feeling better and when I am confident I can race like myself I&#8217;ll be back to the start line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you can probably guess this means no Kona, but to be honest that&#8217;s probably a good thing as I can just take my time to get myself back firing on all cylinders and not force it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He raced Ironman Chattanooga in September, 2024 finishing seventh.</p>
<p>In 2021, Skipper ended up in hospital instead of the start line of Ironman Florida after losing his ability to speak or remember certain things as he was getting ready for an outdoor ride. A CT scan showed nothing but he didn&#8217;t race again that year. Previous to that he suffered a serious bike crash when he was hit by a van during a training session.<br />

<h2>Race is a multi athlete choice award winner</h2>
<p>It was not long ago that the Ironman 70.3 World Championships were held at the same venue. The weather this weekend should be cooler than it was back in December for the championships, as the country heads towards its winter months.</p>
<p>The course is an Ironman favourite, set on the largest freshwater lake in Oceania, the stunning Lake Taupo. Its bike course is scenic and rolling, followed by a flat and fast lakeside run with lots of spectators. It is the longest running Ironman outside of Kona, Hawaii.</p>
<p>The race was awarded fourth place for Most Recommended in the Ironman Athlete&#8217;s Choice Global Awards announced earlier this week. It was chosen first for Most Recommended in the Oceania category, as well as second place for the Best Bike and Best Run, and third for Best Swim.</p>
<p>The Ironman 70.3 Pro Series kicks off at Geelong in Australia on March 23, while the full distance pro series commences a week later in South Africa on March 30.</p>

<p>Last month we reported on the ROUVY/ IRONMAN partnership that saw the Czech-based indoor training platform acquire FulGaz from IRONMAN.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>At that time we had the chance to interview ROUVY CEO Petr Samek, who admitted that it would make no sense to keep both platforms running. The goal, he said, was to migrate FulGaz users over to the ROUVY platform as soon as possible, but not before they could ensure the transition would work.</p>

Before heading into the spring build, spend time identifying your biggest weaknesses and start making improvements before you hit maximum volume in training.</p>
<p>Once your training load gets heavy and there is less room to dial in specific sessions that target weaknesses in the swim, bike and run it will be challenging to address these cracks in performance. Don&#8217;t let another a year go by missing out on the opportunity to fine tune areas that need improvement. These weaknesses will follow you into your high mileage training blocks and not only impede performance but also put you at greater risk for injury.</p>
<h2>Swim smart not hard</h2>
<p>For many athletes their limiters start in the pool. With few of us coming from a strong swim background and a discipline that rewards technical abilities, the swim is on the top of many athlete&#8217;s list of weaknesses. An inefficient stroke can never be overcome by sheer brute. The harder you push in the pool the more energy you will expend. But if your technique is lacking all that effort will only add up to fatigue, not speed.</p>

<p>It is wise to pause hard sessions in the pool until you&#8217;ve addressed technique challenges. The goal is not to transform your swim into a masterpiece. A few tweaks in body position can make a huge difference in speed and energy conservation, saving you time and effort on the bike.</p>
<h2>Technique and speed guarantee gains</h2>
<p>The best approach is to engage someone with expertise, either through in-person coaching sessions or video analysis. The time spent on practicing technique may be frustrating and most athlete&#8217;s will be driven to work harder not smarter. In this case, patience pays off more than effort. Have someone breakdown your stroke and give one to three drills to work on to improve your areas of weakness. Most errors come down to body position causing drag. If this is you, focus on keeping your head down and bum up.</p>
<p>Short speed intervals are another area of swim training often overlooked in favour of endurance. Fast sprinting will improve you anaerobic power and VO2max, making you a fitter, faster athlete all around.</p>

<h2>Beef up your bike muscles</h2>
<p>Do you notice that certain muscles fatigue more than others on the bike? This is a clear indication that your balance and pedalling technique are recruiting some muscles more than others. To stay strong for long you want to be leveraging all your muscles equally so that none tire prematurely from overwork.</p>
<p>It is common for athletes to notice their quads take the brunt of the action. This is a red flag that your pedal stroke is more focused on pushing rather than pulling. This means you aren&#8217;t getting all that you can out of your hamstrings. Include single leg pedal drills, and workouts that focus on a smooth stroke, over power metrics. Before the workouts become highly focused on output, work to balance out the use of all your major muscle groups.</p>
<p>A smooth pedal stroke will avoid a muscle bonk on the bike because one group has been doing the work of two or more. Spread that work out between the quads, hamstrings and hips so your power and energy can take you farther on the road.</p>

<h2>Sprint to the finish</h2>
<p>As with the swim, the anaerobic system is often neglected in favour of threshold, hills and long rides. The max power you develop doing anaerobic work will raise the ceiling for all your other power numbers. Include short bursts of energy, surges or sprints in your training toolbox to build max power now so you can apply that elevated ceiling to all the workouts that await you in the build up to your next race.</p>
<p>Not to be overlooked, your bike fit could be contributing to the imbalance of power in your pedal stroke and power transfer. As you trained and got stronger (and possibly more flexible) over winter, your ideal position on the bike may have changed. It is always prudent to get an updated bike fit before spring to ensure you are maximizing power, comfort and aerodynamics on the bike.</p>
<p>Anywhere from 20 to 60 seconds of all out sprinting will prime and strengthen this system and is an important component to raising your overall functional threshold power.</p>
<h2>Relax to run faster</h2>
<p>It can feel counterintuitive to purposefully relax on the run in order to go faster. Harder is faster, right? Not so. Similar to the swim, a relaxed form is smoother and more efficient. Instead of focusing on your pace during speed sessions, focus on cueing your body to relax. You will not only run faster and farther, you will use less energy. It will also feel nicer, and the run doesn&#8217;t always feel nice for the innate cyclists in triathlon.</p>
<p>Think smooth, not fast when running and swimming. On the bike the smooth not fast cue is great when doing pedal stroke drills. Consider it a secret weapon that also creates space for you to check in on how you are actually feeling while running by doing a body scan. Learn to become aware of body parts that naturally tighten up like shoulders or abdominals.</p>
<p>Fluid is fast on the run. Regularly cue yourself to relax and float through your speed sessions.</p>

<h2>Bonus marks for strength and mobility</h2>
<p>Often pushed aside like dirty socks in the corner of your room, strength and mobility work is hugely beneficial. The challenge with these auxiliary sessions is not that they are hard, it&#8217;s that they are difficult to fit in. When crunched for time we gravitate to the main session and what we enjoy most.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s forgivable, and you won&#8217;t sabotage your season if you don&#8217;t spend the recommended time and attention on strength and mobility but you will see gains if you do. The off season is the perfect time to get in the gym when volume is generally lower, allowing the body to manage this additional stress. Not only will you feel stronger in the swim, bike and run but you are less likely to get injured.</p>
<p>Just two days a week doing basic compound exercises like squats, lunges and deadlifts is a great start. Include single leg exercises as well to identify and strengthen the imbalances that show up in your pedal stroke and run gait.</p>
<p>A sneaky and smart way to incorporate mobility into your program is using it as part of a warm up and cool down for your main sessions. Even five to 10 minutes on either end of a workout can help with injury prevention and flexibility, which can help you stay more relaxed on the run and more aerodynamic on your bike.</p>
<p>Now is the time to address these limiters. Before long the snow will melt and you&#8217;ll be putting in the long, beautiful miles we love most.</p>

<p>A critical component of President Donald Trump&#8217;s foreign and economic policies are the use of tariffs &#8212; the tax or duty paid on imported goods from certain countries. The ones that made early headlines were <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-china-mexico-canada-inflation-753a09d56cd318f2eb1d2efe3c43b7d4"" title="""">those announced on Canadian and Mexican goods</a> and their potential to disrupt free trade through North America; these are <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-71761a2894e13a050717afda4fd8131a"" title="""">apparently going to take effect on Tuesday, March 4th</a>.</p>



<p>And then there&#8217;s China. Yesterday, <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8yy3wpn6eo"" title="""">President Trump announced plans for a further 10% tariff on Chinese imports</a>, on top of an existing 10% tariff that was announced earlier this year.

<p>Three 2026 Age Group World Triathlon Multisport Championship spots will be awarded to the top finishers in each age category. Next year&#8217;s multisport world championships is in Abu Dhabi. Athletes interested in claiming a spot must fill out an Expression of Interest before the race, which is done through Triathlon Canada&#8217;s website within one week of the event.</p>
<p>Athletes not wishing to claim a spot for the 2026 championships can still race the cross triathlon.</p>
<h2>Experience and tradition in Edmonton</h2>
<p>Organizers at Do North Events bring years of experience with their strong ties to World Triathlon. The area has been the site of past World Triathlon Champion Series racing, including hosting the Grand Final in 2014 and 2021. Over the years it has welcomed all the greats from Canada as well as Olympians from around the world.</p>

<p>The 2025 Do North Tri &amp; Trail offers road races in addition to its championship trail race. The event brings back its classic age group sprint race on the Saturday, along with team and junior triathlon events. Sunday is dedicated to the trails with the championship race first up, followed by a DO-athlon.</p>
<h2>Changes to the historic course</h2>
<p>A notable change this year is the venue site. Due to construction at its long-held location in Hawrelak Park, races is taking place at Kinsmen Park. The swim will no longer be open water. Athletes will instead do the first leg of the race in the Queen Elizabeth outdoor pool. The bike and run courses take athletes across the Walterdale bridge and into the river valley below.</p>
<p>The cross course starts in the pool before athletes head out on their mountain bikes along the intricate trail system right in the heart of the city. The run continues along the scenic trail routes with views of the valley and cityscape.</p>

<p>Designed for every type of off-road riding from easy trails to technical, rocky tracks, a mountain bike has flat handlebars for control and chunky, often knobbly tyres, for grip.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people ride MTBs on the road too, but they can be slow for longer rides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A gravel bike borrows drop handlebars and the riding position from a road bike while the tyres have more in common with a mountain bike’s.</p>



<p>Suitable for most types of terrain and surface, many beginner cyclists get on well with gravel bikes.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-hybrid"">Hybrid</h4>



<p>A hybrid is essentially a mountain bike with slicker and slightly narrower tyres. These versatile bikes are popular for commuting and touring.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-town-bike"">Town bike</h4>



<p></p>



<p>With a relaxed riding position and convenient accessories like mudguards, racks and baskets often fitted as standard, town bikes are ideal for cruising around urban areas.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-electric-bike"">Electric bike</h4>



<p>All types of bikes can be fitted with a motor and battery to become an electric bike. Electric bikes aren’t cheating – you still have to pedal – and they’re great fun to ride.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are more expensive than unassisted bikes though.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whichever type of bike you go for, invest in a quality bike lock if you plan to leave it unattended in public. Don’t forget to research the relevant bike insurance because bikes aren’t always included in your home insurance coverage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learn how to do basic bike maintenance yourself (there’s a YouTube video for most tasks) and take your bike to a professional mechanic for more complex jobs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s best to have an expert set up your bike for you: if you purchase from a cycling shop, they should do this for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To do a<a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/bike-training/perfect-bike-set-up""> <strong>DIY bike fit</strong></a>, make sure there&#8217;s a slight bend in your leg when your foot is at the bottom of the pedal stroke in the six o’clock position. </p>



<p>You should be able to reach the handlebars and brakes comfortably with a slight bend in your elbows. Move them higher or closer if you feel yourself overstretching.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although cycling should be comfortable overall, the odd ache and bit of soreness are inevitable, especially for beginners.

<p>Cycling does call for a fair bit of kit, but there’s no need to spend a fortune on cycling accessories.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-helmet"">Helmet</h4>



<p>While not a legal requirement in the UK, we think you should wear a helmet on every bike ride. The <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/helmets/best-road-bike-helmets-for-triathlon""><strong>best bike helmets</strong> </a>are protective, light, well ventilated and comfortable, so there’s no reason not to. </p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-puncture-repair-nbsp"">Puncture repair&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Punctures happen to all cyclists, so knowing <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/how-to-repair-a-puncture-quickly-during-a-race""><strong>how to fix a roadside puncture</strong></a> is an essential skill. We recommend that you carry spares and tools such as inner tubes, tyre levers, a bike bump and multitool. </p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-lights"">Lights</h4>



<p>It’s a legal requirement to have front and rear lights when cycling after dark in most countries. Check out our recommendations in our guide to the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/accessories/bike-lights/best-bike-lights""><strong>best bike lights</strong></a>. </p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-eyewear"">Eyewear</h4>



<p><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/triathlon/eyewear/best-triathlon-sunglasses""><strong>Cycling sunglasses</strong></a> do more than keep the sun out of your eyes. They also protect them from flies, dirt and water that can fly into your face. </p>

<p>You can wear everyday clothes for a lot of cycling, especially riding in town at a relaxed pace.</p>



<p>As you start to ride faster and further, you might want to consider specific cycling clothing. <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/bike-clothing/best-bib-cycling-shorts""><strong>Padded cycling shorts</strong></a> are much more comfortable on longer rides. Cycling jerseys have handy pockets to store things and wick sweat better than cotton. For UK cyclists, the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/bike-clothing/best-cycling-jackets""><strong>best cycling jackets</strong></a> are worth investing in to stay dry. </p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">

<li><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/bike-clothing/best-womens-cycling-jerseys""><strong>Best women’s cycling jerseys</strong></a></li>
</ul>



<p>Likewise, you can cycle in normal shoes on flat pedals. But for improved comfort, stability and power transfer, the next items on your list might be <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/bike-shoes/best-road-bike-shoes-reviewed""><strong>cycling shoes</strong></a> and <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/components/best-clipless-pedals-for-triathlon""><strong>clipless pedals</strong></a>. </p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-hydration-and-nutrition"">Hydration and nutrition</h4>



<p><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/bike-training/how-many-calories-does-cycling-burn#:~:text=Elite%20runners%20and%20cyclists%20will,energy%20at%20their%20moderate%20pace.""><strong>Cycling can burn a lot of calories</strong></a>, so as you get fitter and increase the length of your rides to more than 90 minutes, you should take water and snacks with you to maintain energy levels. </p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/nutrition/energy-bars/best-energy-bars-reviewed""><strong>best energy bars</strong> </a>and <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/nutrition/energy-gels/best-energy-gels-reviewed""><strong>best energy gels</strong> </a>are great when you’re working harder. When you’re not, real food like bananas and cereal bars are more than adequate. </p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-bike-computers"">Bike computers</h4>



<p>For venturing further afield and recording your rides, many cyclists use <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/accessories/bike-computers/best-bike-computers-reviewed""><strong>bike computers </strong></a>or <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/tri-tech/multisport-watches/best-triathlon-watches-reviewed""><strong>multisport watches</strong></a>. </p>



<p>A cheaper solution is a mobile phone securely mounted to your handlebars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, we recommend getting used to cycling on a flat, quiet stretch of tarmac: a segregated off-road cycle lane is ideal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like tuition, <a href=""https://www.bikeability.org.uk/""><strong>Bikeability</strong></a>, the UK government’s cycle training scheme, comes highly recommended. It puts on classes for children and adults alike. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/education-course-finder""><strong>British Cycling also runs education courses</strong></a> for beginner and more experienced cyclists. </p>



<p>When you really catch the pedalling bug, joining a cycling club can take you to the next level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’re fun, sociable and supportive communities that cater to all levels and disciplines of cycling. Most will have slower, shorter rides and some organise on and off road rides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning<strong> <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/bike-training/group-bike-riding-etiquette-explained-for-triathletes#:~:text=Ride%20two%20abreast%20most%20of,van%20de%20Broek%20%2F%20Unsplash)."">how to ride in a group</a></strong> is also a valuable skill. You can ride much further and faster in a group, which will help your fitness progress. Plus if anything goes wrong with you or your bike, it’s better to be in company. It will also make organised cycling events much less daunting. </p>

<p>Initially cycling takes getting used to: you sit in a largely fixed position and <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/bike-training/what-muscles-do-you-use-and-tone-when-cycling""><strong>work different muscles compared to running and swimming</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Therefore, little and often is best to begin with. A gentle 20-30 minute ride several times a week will be enough to see you improve. Riding laps around a short circuit means you won&#8217;t get stranded too far from home. </p>



<p>Increase time and distance gradually: as a general rule by no more than 10 per cent a week.&nbsp;</p>

Get ready for the noise. Get ready for the speed. The Lievin World Indoor Cup is back in less than four weeks and it promises to be an event unlike any other on the calendar.</p>



<p>With multiple world champions and WTCS gold medallists on the start line, the racing will be a battle royale over multiple rounds where putting even a single foot wrong could prove fatal to any medal hopes. Read on to find out which names are headlining the provisional start lists and some of the stories to track ahead of the action.</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Who’s there?</h2>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Men</h3>



<p>He’s already notched a win at WTCS Abu Dhabi this season and now he will be after more. Hayden Wilde will be one of many making his Lievin debut as he looks to maintain his perfect start to 2025. A winner at WTCS Hamburg in 2023, which was contested over the super sprint eliminator format, Wilde has long since proven himself over the shorter distances. With speed to burn, he will arrive as the favourite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Wilde faces two significant French obstacles in his path to glory. World champions Dorian Coninx and Leo Bergere will be making their first starts of the season and will be in no mood to let Wilde steal the limelight before a home audience. Like Wilde, Coninx has also been successful over the super sprint format in the WTCS, triumphing in Montreal back in 2021.</p>



<p>With World Cup winner Yanis Seguin and 2023 World U23 Championships medallist Baptiste Passemard also in their ranks, the French men will aim for multiple medals in Lievin.</p>



<p>Henry Graf is certainly the man of the moment after anchoring the German Mixed Team Relay to gold in Abu Dhabi after finishing a brilliant 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;in the individual race. Look for him to make a big impact in Lievin. Likewise, Ben Dijkstra is another on a high after impressing on his WTCS debut last month. He will have 2022 World U23 Championships medallist Hamish Reilly for company on the British team.</p>



<p>Mitch Kolkman, the Paris Olympian, was the fastest swimmer in the men’s final last year and the Dutch athlete will hope for more this time round. World Cup winner Genis Grau could be key to Spain’s hopes while Nicola Azzano and Euan De Nigro are fresh off leading Italy to the bronze medal in the Mixed Team Relay World Series event in Abu Dhabi.</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Women</h3>



<p>She’s back.</p>



<p>Two words the elite women’s field were probably dreading to read in 2025 have arrived as Olympic and world champion Cassandre Beaugrand makes her first start of the season. Any hopes that she will not be in top shape following the&nbsp;<em>magnum opus</em>&nbsp;that was her 2024 season have already been obliterated by her recent French 5km road record. With a home crowd to impress, Lievin will be an encore of sorts from the Paris Olympics. Expect Beaugrand to put on a show at her homecoming.</p>



<p>WTCS medallist Emma Lombardi and World Cup winner Sandra Dodet will also be in contention. The former will be particularly fascinating to watch as she looks to emerge from the shadow of her illustrious teammate. With further French talent on the start line, a podium sweep is eminently possible.</p>



<p>One country that knows a thing or two about sweeping podiums is neighbouring Germany and they will be out in full force in Lievin. Laura Lindemann is back to defend her gold medal from last year while her fellow WTCS Abu Dhabi medallist Nina Eim is also on the start line.</p>



<p>Throw in WTCS medallists Annika Koch and Lena Meißner, as well as Tanja Neubert, the start of the relay in Abu Dhabi (and the 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;place finisher individually), and this is not a team wanting for depth.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Jolien Vermeylen of Belgium will look to ruffle some feathers after claiming a maiden World Cup win at the end of 2024, Switzerland’s Cathia Schär could threaten lap some athletes with her phenomenal bike power over the short 200m laps, and Celine Senia has the chance to cause an upset racing under the World Triathlon colours as she switches her sporting nationality from France to Spain.</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Four talking points</h2>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">A Franco-German affair</h3>



<p>Don’t you just hate it when you organise a wonderful party with great food, music and vibes only for your neighbour to come crashing through the wall and ruin your best-laid plans. In some ways, this is the chilling prospect facing the hosts in Lievin.</p>



<p>With three world champions starting and a glittering line-up in general, the home French team will be the favourites to come away with the most medals. Wilde is an obvious spoiler on the men’s side, although as the only athlete from New Zealand racing he does not really pose a great threat to the overall medal tally. Instead, the German squad appear best positioned to crash the home team’s party with its surfeit of talent.</p>



<p>Considering the strength of the French and German line-ups, the question at this stage is not whether they will come away with any medals. Nor is it how many medals they will win. Rather, the question to ask is which of the two will out-do the other on the medal table. If France are to have the party they hope for in Lievin, they will have to meet the challenge of the guests from over the border that are unlikely to stand demurely in the corner.</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Lindemann with a point to prove?</h3>



<p>From an objective standpoint, the answer to the question “does Laura Lindemann have a point to prove” is simple. No. She doesn’t. A WTCS winner, an Olympic gold medallist and perhaps the single best female relay anchor of the past two years, she has attained highs few can aspire to. As the defending champion in Lievin, she will expect the gold this time round. Even accounting for Beaugrand’s sensational levels, over the shortest distances few can contend with Lindemann.</p>



<p>Moreover, she arrives in form; Lindemann recently medalled at WTCS Abu Dhabi. And yet Abu Dhabi is the entire reason for the question posed here. By finishing as the third German woman on the podium, a threat now exists to Lindemann’s place at the top of the national pecking order. It is an unfamiliar position for an athlete that has so often been the face of German triathlon for the best part of the last decade.</p>



<p>One of the women that beat her in Abu Dhabi, Eim, also won in Lievin in 2022 when it was a European Cup. Having out-sprinted Lindemann in Abu Dhabi, Eim will back herself to do so again in France. Lindemann therefore finds herself with compatriots nipping at her heels and while she does not have anything to prove&nbsp;<em>per se</em>, she may look to put a few rivals in their places in Lievin.</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Seguin’s audition</h3>



<p>Vincent Luis is gone. Leo Bergere is moving up to the T100 this year. Dorian Coninx is into his 30s. Pierre Le Corre is seemingly immortal and still going strong, but even he might decide the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028 are a bridge too far. Altogether, the image facing the French men’s team is a cycle of upheaval and renewal. Step forward Yanis Seguin.</p>



<p>The winner of the Rome World Cup last year, Seguin also finished 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;at the World Cup in Samarkand and at the European Championships in Vichy. He is very much the coming man of French triathlon and in Lievin he will have the chance to establish himself as France’s leading man over the next Olympic cycle. With Bergere and Coninx in attendance, this will be the chance for Seguin to score a victory over his compatriots that could prove to be bigger than the race itself.</p>



<hr class=""wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity""/>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Holding your nerve</h3>



<p>The format in Lievin demands speed, but it also requires patience. With each round consisting of a 200m swim, 2.8km bike and 1km run, the races are over quickly. Last year’s results indicate that a glorious long-range attack will not pay off and, while it would be amazing to see an electrifying solo attack lift the crowd of 5000 to their feet, chances are the deciding move will come in the final 100m.</p>



<p>Sprint finishes settled the A and B finals last year and more of the same can be expected this time around. Anyone that saw Dorian Coninx’s sprint finish to win the WTCS Final in 2023 will be inclined to back him. Similarly, Beaugrand came out on top in multiple sprint showdowns with Lisa Tertsch and Beth Potter in last year’s WTCS.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, with several athletes bumping shoulders in a narrow, mad-cap last dash to the line with the full force of the arena in their heads, keeping one’s cool will be easier said than done. Speed will be important however holding one’s nerve will be everything.</p>

<p>The supertri E World Championship started life as the &#8216;Super League Triathlon Arena Games&#8217;.</p>



<p>It sees athletes compete using both real-life and virtual racing (using MyWhoosh) within an arena environment. That means the swimming will take place in a pool, while the cycling and running will be on smart bikes and treadmills.</p>



<p>This format used to take place over a few locations, but now it&#8217;s a one-day World Championship event in partnership with World Triathlon.</p>



<p>For the first time, the 2025 event will mirror the unique and high-pressure Supertri format of three continuous rounds of swim, bike and run.</p>



<p>The racing begins with a number of qualifying heats, which will result with just 10 men and 10 women making it through to the finals.</p>



<p>The morning heats will see athletes complete two continuous rounds of swim-bike-run.</p>



<p>The finals will then take place over three stages of swim-bike-run</p>

But would he finish in one piece?",https://www.220triathlon.com/news/rss,"<p><strong>I can see there’s a right turn ahead and an arrow, but I feel that any advisory words would present a much more significant challenge. The big wide forest track is changing into something much narrower and windier. The snow makes progress difficult, and I’ve just jumped back on my saddle after succumbing to the somewhat inevitable sliding. </strong></p>



<p>As I bang my <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/bike-shoes/best-road-bike-shoes-reviewed"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">cycling shoes</a></strong> on the side of the bike to free up the cleats from any compacted snow, I look up and read the sign. “Gnarly trails ahead”. I now remember that I’ve seen this sign before, on a picture of the course on Facebook. I’d rather hoped this section would be on the run leg.</p>



<p>With no idea what’s in store, I ride on and down, elbows out and very thankful that at least no-one’s pressing me from behind. Up until now I feel I’ve been doing ok, the <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/bike-training/cycling-how-to-use-hills-to-build-a-strong-winter-base"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">long climb</a></strong> from the start spreading out the field nicely, and I’m more or less in control. But a change feels imminent. </p>



<p>I only just manage to stay upright as I ride, slide, bump and twist down the <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/run-training/tips-for-running-in-the-snow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">snowy</a></strong> singletrack. I quickly become aware that I do very little of this type of riding. A visit or two to a trail centre would have been helpful in the build-up. I feel compelled to apologise as I see photographer Andy. He’s a well-known figure in Scottish <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/what-type-of-mountain-bike-is-best-for-an-off-road-triathlon-or-duathlon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">mountain biking</a></strong> and has worked with people like Danny McAskill. </p>



<p>The contrast with what he’s just witnessed could not have been starker. He does well not to shake his head in disgust as I ride past him. Ever the optimist, he shouts some words of encouragement. I’m relieved to be spat out onto the wider track, as another rider flies past. I have my standard forlorn thought – I’ll get him on the run.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-racing-off-road""><strong>Racing off-road</strong></h3>



<p>I’m on the bike leg of the <strong><a href=""https://durtyevents.com/our-events/bowhill-duathlon-long-course/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Bowhill Duathlon</a></strong> in the Scottish Borders. This is the first race of Durty Event’s winter off-road <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/beginners/how-to-train-for-a-duathlon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">duathlon</a></strong> series. I’ve enjoyed racing over the<strong> <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/how-to-improve-your-triathlon-race-performance-in-winter"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">winter</a></strong> during the past couple of years, but those races were in the Middle East, the Sahara, and Cyprus. </p>



<p>As we drove to the race in sub-zero temperatures and with snow all around, I was concerned that my recent found love of winter races was about to come to a very abrupt halt. Like many of us, the festive period for me had involved little movement other than that of cutlery and pint glasses.</p>



<p>Time to start the engine; I just need to find it first. The week of the race was properly cold. Nighttime temperatures fell well below zero and pre-race thoughts were all about keeping warm. The race is an 8.5km bike and a 6km run. All off-road, the key question was how “off-road”?</p>

<p>Durty Events’ head man Paul McGreal has a solid reputation for making things rough. I was confident that we&#8217;d be tackling a mountain rather than <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/gravel-bikes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">gravel bike</a></strong> course, but <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/run/run-shoes/best-running-shoes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">running shoe</a></strong> choice was going to be tricky. Like a true professional, I grabbed the first three pairs I could find in my garage and went with the ones that were the quickest to put on. </p>



<p>I decided on two pairs of thin <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/run/run-clothing/best-running-socks"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">running socks</a> </strong>with small plastic bags between them. Arm warmers, under-helmet cap, and two pairs of <strong>gloves</strong> completed my starting outfit. The bike is a mass start and I’m fearful of unwanted jostling to get in position. I needn’t have worried as people seem far more focused on staying warm, blowing on their glove-covered hands, their collective breaths forming steam in an impressive dry ice-like show. </p>



<p>I meet Isla Short. She’s been Scotland’s top cross country mountain biker for many years. Her ponytail will be a good target, or so I hope. I place myself about ten riders back thinking that might be where I’d finish. Off we go with no crazy out of the saddle stuff.</p>

<p>Warming up nicely, I settle into a rhythm and feel ok. Isla’s ponytail is just up ahead. The first singletrack descent is a big wakeup call though, and I’m struggling to stop spinning on the wider snow-covered tracks. Others seem to cope much better and pass me with ease. </p>



<p>I hold my place until we come to a wide descent. Bits of it look frozen to me and I proceed with caution. Others don’t and blast past, all staying upright. Losing places badly, I need to get to <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/race-day-advice/triathlon-transitions-a-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-transition-faster-and-more-efficiently"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">transition</a></strong>, but not before another single-track descent under the trees and over the fallen leaves. What if there’s something underneath them? </p>



<p>Nobody else seems concerned as they charge past. Isla will be flying down this stuff I think to myself, but I most definitely am not. Hesitation has now become ponderous progress. I comfort myself that I’ll have plenty people to chase on the run. Frankly, far too many.</p>



<p>I sit down in transition. Not the done thing I know, but there’s a bit to do here. I take off one pair of sock and bags. I remove both sets of gloves, but then grab the smaller pair just in case and stuff them in my back pocket. The arm warmers can go too. </p>



<p>Just like I do these days when leaving the house, I go through a mental checklist to make sure I have everything, even mentioning each item out loud. I grab an <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/nutrition/energy-gels/best-energy-gels-reviewed"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">energy gel</a> </strong>and put my shoes on. </p>



<p>OK, good to go. No, my <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/helmets/best-road-bike-helmets-for-triathlon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">bike helmet</a></strong> is still on! I blame it on the cold and eventually run out, head uncovered.</p>

<p>Moving that head from side to side, I try peering through the trees in the hope that I’ll see some competitors ahead. I know very well that even a fleeting glimpse of some legs through the gaps in the timber will lift my spirits. </p>



<p>I’m well back now and have some catching up to do. I see some others, but they might be marshals. Trying to find my running rhythm, we’re suddenly directed up a 45-degree slope. Needing to use my arms as well as legs to make progress, I curse Paul and can feel him chuckling back.</p>

</ul>



<p>On the steeper bits, I know it can be demoralising for others ahead if they look back and see you running these types of sections. Yet my desire to look intimidating is outshone by my wish to not blow a gasket, so I’m resigned to a walk. I try to look like I’m comfortable, but I’m most certainly not. </p>



<p>Descending now, there’s ice around and my feet are slipping. I’m catching the guy in front, but need him to check the ground ahead, so don’t pass him and instead avoid the areas he’s slipping on. Desperate measures. </p>

<p>Although I’m wearing <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/run/run-shoes/best-trail-running-shoes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">off-road running shoes</a></strong>, I’m slipping far too much. More <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/run-training/whats-the-best-foot-strike-for-running"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>forefoot striking</strong> </a>and weight forward behaviour is needed, but for now I’d just like to get through this section in one piece.</p>



<p>Like the bike course but even more so, the course bends tightly and weaves its way through the forest. There’s a wide variety of terrain which is great brain food and the kilometres tick along. I’ve no idea where I am and in which direction I’m heading, but the signage is spot on, so I push forward. </p>



<p>We’re lower down now, and the snow and ice has subsided. With others in the distance and just about catchable, I can’t deny this is fun and even manage a smile. The positive energy makes me run better – I should adopt that mental process more. </p>



<p>I hear footsteps closing in behind and hope to see an out and out runner pass me which would mean a team, but the tri-suits says otherwise. </p>



<p>I take one final squeeze and gulp of my gel as we approach the finish area. I’m not entirely sure where the end is and all too soon, I’m in the estate courtyard and under the inflated finishing banner. I finished in 1 hour and six minutes for 12th place. </p>

<p>I didn’t feel particularly tired at the end which inevitably left me questioning my pacing, but I couldn’t have gone much harder. Looking back, I did make two poor kit choices. I knew my back <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/bike/components/wheels/best-triathlon-tyres"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">tyre</a></strong> was somewhat worn and that had made a difference. </p>



<p>I spent far too much time slipping, sliding and just generally feeling out of control. Still, tyres aren’t cheap and I’m not planning on doing a great deal more biking on snow. </p>



<p>Also, my running shoes were all over the place. I spoke to the winner Ewan Brown at the end, and he was in proper fell running shoes, which I should probably have worn. Nevertheless, although it’s all too tempting to make them, comparisons in these situations are of limited value. </p>



<p>Ewan is a top-class athlete whom I last saw winning Celtman by almost half an hour. I am not. Kit is important, but the user is more so. With age, I’m very aware that I’m becoming poorer and poorer at <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/run-training/how-to-run-downhill"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">descending when running</a></strong>, and there’s only so much the right shoes will help with that. Still, I’d like to have known how much difference that would’ve made here.</p>



<p>I’d been reluctant to race – I’d worked out that I hadn’t done a multisport event in a Scottish winter for almost two decades – but I loved the race and whole experience. </p>



<p>I did have a feeling of unfinished business, especially as I’d made such a mess of the technical parts of the course, so I might just give the next race in the series a go. The conditions would of course have to be somewhat less challenging, but then again, I can’t seem to find that option on the entry form!</p>

<p><a href=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-861280178.jpg""><img decoding=""async"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-25241"" src=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-861280178.jpg"" alt="""" width=""724"" height=""483"" srcset=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-861280178.jpg 724w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-861280178-300x200.jpg 300w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-861280178-160x107.jpg 160w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-861280178-320x213.jpg 320w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-861280178-480x320.jpg 480w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-861280178-640x427.jpg 640w"" sizes=""(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"" /></a></p>
<p>Really? That&#8217;s a question? Think about this &#8211; even the most minimalist triathlon program includes six to eight workouts a week. It&#8217;s hard to imagine any sort of race prep that includes less than 10 hours of training a week. That&#8217;s a lot of burnt calories. There&#8217;s a reason my friends used to say that I was on a &#8220;see food&#8221; diet when I first turned pro &#8211; everything I saw, I ate.</p>
<h2>Why do they get a tattoo of the name of a corporation?</h2>
<p><img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-74045"" src=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Age-Grouper-Ironman-Tattoo.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""400"" srcset=""https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Age-Grouper-Ironman-Tattoo.jpg 300w, https://triathlonmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Age-Grouper-Ironman-Tattoo-225x300.jpg 225w"" sizes=""(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"" /></p>
<p>Yes, it makes no sense for the rest of you, but for us triathletes, letting everyone know that we&#8217;ve done an Ironman is a huge deal. No, we don&#8217;t want to tattoo any other corporate logos on our bodies. This one, though, we really want!</p>
<h2>Why do they always talk about gear?</h2>
<p>Do you know how much of a difference a disc wheel can make to your finish time? You can shave minutes off your time with a new bike, or wetsuit. And now there are all these super-shoes to think about &#8230;</p>
<h2>Why do they get up so early?</h2>
<p><iframe class=""giphy-embed"" src=""https://giphy.com/embed/1fiID8fMeBLZugvD6N"" width=""480"" height=""270"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>Unfortunately, while some of us might train as if we made a living from the sport, we don&#8217;t actually make a living from the sport. So we have jobs. So, to get our training in, we need to start early. And we&#8217;ll often rush off at lunch, or after work, to do more training, too. That&#8217;s what happens when you have three sports to train for.</p>
<p>Oh, and that&#8217;s why we can&#8217;t stay out late, either. Even on weekends. Sunday morning rides are best done really early, too, in order to beat the traffic.</p>
<h2>Why do they always talk about training?</h2>
<p><iframe class=""giphy-embed"" src=""https://giphy.com/embed/LnjX1YzwvwPxgX06NF"" width=""480"" height=""480"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>It takes up a lot of our life. We&#8217;d like to not talk about training all the time, but &#8230; well, we just can&#8217;t help ourselves.</p>
<h2>Why do they wear so much Lycra?</h2>
<p><iframe class=""giphy-embed"" src=""https://giphy.com/embed/Y151ZSXCyraUXfIsGD"" width=""480"" height=""320"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>Sure, it might not be your thing, but it&#8217;s comfortable. It&#8217;s aerodynamic. Yes, it might not be flattering on many of us, and we totally agree it shouldn&#8217;t be worn anywhere but training. The problem is, we do spend a lot of time training &#8230;</p>

<p>The folks at Challenge Roth have been releasing the names on their pro list over the past few weeks and, for the most part, we figured we&#8217;d leave it all be until the entire list had come out. Today&#8217;s announcement, though, feels a bit more newsworthy &#8211; reigning IRONMAN world champion Laura Philipp will be heading back to Roth for the third time.</p>



<p>To understand why this is a big deal, you have to go back to roots of Challenge Roth and the triathlon history of the small town that hosts the event. The first triathlon took place in Roth in 1984 &#8211; a 700 m swim, 40 km bike and a 10 km run. In 1988 the town hosted the first IRONMAN Europe race, which quickly became one of the biggest IRONMAN events on the circuit. The event was owned by the Walchshofer family and run by Detlef Kuhnel. In 2001 Kuhnel got wind that IRONMAN was negotiating with Frankfurt to put on an IRONMAN race and announced that the 2001 race in Roth would be the last IRONMAN event. (The Challenge Roth website describes the split this way: &#8220;Due to unacceptable organisational and financial demands, the contract with World Triathlon Corporation was terminated at the beginning of the new millennium.&#8221;)</p>



<p>So, in 2002 there were two major full-distance races held in Germany at the beginning of July &#8211; the IRONMAN European Championship in Frankfurt, and Challenge Roth. Having the two events vying for media attention was huge for professional German athletes as they negotiated appearance fees and contracts.</p>



<p>Which brings us back to Laura Philipp. It&#8217;s always been a big deal for the folks in Roth to get the reigning world champion to their race. Chrissie Wellington was a regular in Roth, and Daniela Ryf made a number of appearances there during her Kona run. Ditto for Jan Frodeno, and even Kona champ Patrick Lange has been on the start line after Kona wins. (This year Lange has announced he&#8217;ll be in Frankfurt.) The negotiations would have been a bit easier since the women&#8217;s IRONMAN European Championship is taking place in Hamburg at the beginning of June, and Frankfurt, which takes place at the end of June, is the men&#8217;s race. It&#8217;s been implied that Philipp will be gunning after the IRONMAN Pro Series title this year, which means she&#8217;d need to get three full-distance IRONMAN races in along with a couple of 70.3s if she truly aims to be competitive for that title. She&#8217;ll also be very motivated to defend her IRONMAN world title in Kona, too. </p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""682"" src=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ironman-World-Championship-Nice-race-dayKM86127-1024x682.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-67463"" srcset=""https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ironman-World-Championship-Nice-race-dayKM86127-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ironman-World-Championship-Nice-race-dayKM86127-300x200.jpg 300w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ironman-World-Championship-Nice-race-dayKM86127-768x512.jpg 768w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ironman-World-Championship-Nice-race-dayKM86127-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://slowtwitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ironman-World-Championship-Nice-race-dayKM86127.jpg 2000w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption""><em>Photo: Kevin Mackinnon</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Today&#8217;s announcement, though, makes me wonder if the goal is more focussed on winning in Kona than that IRONMAN Pro Series. Last year Philipp competed in three 70.3 races (she was second in Mallorca and won Kraichgau), four T100 races, Challenge Roth and, of course, the worlds in Nice. The only year she&#8217;s done more than two full-distance races in a year was 2023 &#8211; she won IRONMAN South Africa, took third in Roth and then was third again in Kona. Last year she &#8220;only&#8221; did two full-distance races &#8211; Roth and Nice. With that in mind, I can&#8217;t imagine that Philipp will take on four full-distance races in 2025, which means today&#8217;s announcement will make a run at the Pro Series title a tough one. </p>



<p>All of which is to say, my guess is the folks at Roth were very keen to sign the reigning IRONMAN world champ to the race this year and wrote a check that made the decision a bit easier for Philipp and her team. (Of course, I could be completely off the mark and the feeling is Philipp can take on the challenge of four full-distance races and two 70.3s &#8211; I&#8217;m open to being wrong on this front!) And, after finishing third in 2023 (where Daniela Ryf set a new world best time of 8:08:21), then second in 2024 (when Anne Haug ripped through an incredible 8:02:38 world best), Philipp is no-doubt thinking its her turn to take the top of the podium. Last year she went 8:14:13 &#8211; will it be her turn to go close to eight hours?</p>



<p>&#8220;I would like to try my luck again at the Challenge in Roth in 2025,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the event in Germany and the most atmospheric triathlon in the world. I&#8217;m looking forward to the race.&#8221;</p>

London calling: Alex Yee’s London Marathon training,https://www.220triathlon.com/news/lalex-yee-london-marathon-training-plan,Tim Heming,2025-02-27 12:05:00+00:00,"['News', 'Run', 'Training']","{'@isPermaLink': 'false', '#text': 'https://www.220triathlon.com/?p=168489'}","In an event for the ages, COROS athlete Alex Yee will take on this year’s TCS London Marathon. Here’s how he’s training for it...",https://www.220triathlon.com/news/rss,"<p><strong>When Alex Yee took the finish line tape cross-armed and fixed a steely gaze down the camera lens, it caused a bit of a stir. Just as at the Olympics a month earlier, Yee had outsprinted Hayden Wilde. This time to win a Supertri event in Boston, but unlike in Paris where they had embraced on the blue carpet, now there seemed to be an edge</strong>. </p>



<p>Was Yee’s longtime friendship with the Kiwi starting to turn a bit fractious? Not really. In the clamour for a post-race news line, too much was made of Yee’s celebration, but in contrast to the broad grin that marks him out as one of the most easy-mannered triathletes in the world, it was a visceral reminder of his determination. </p>



<p>For all of Yee’s natural talent and flowing running form, he hasn’t become the <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-alex-yee"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">most decorated Olympic triathlete</a></strong> in history (two golds, one silver, one bronze&#8230; and counting) without the attitude to win.</p>



<p>Both the smile and the work ethic will be present when he steps up to his next big challenge this spring as Yee takes a departure from the competitive rigours of swim, bike and run to hit the streets with 50,000 plus other nervous entrants in this year’s <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/alex-yee-predicted-london-marathon-time"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">TCS London Marathon</a></strong>.</p>



<p>To manage expectations, this isn’t about winning the race. It’s an exciting opportunity to see how triathlon’s best shapes up against the world’s best, and while Yee has said somewhere between 2:07 and 2:10 might be attainable, he’s well aware that even such an impressive debut (sub 2:08 would put him in the all-time GB top five) is only likely to put him among the &#8216;also-rans&#8217; coming down the Mall.</p>

<p>If Yee needed any further reminders of that, then a 28:07 clocking over 10km on the roads of Valencia on the second Sunday in January, placed him 29th. He’s stepping into a different game here in the competitive running world, with new threats emerging, chiefly from east Africa, almost every race.</p>



<p>But Yee, who grew up competing for Kent Athletic Club and has proven himself to be the best short course runner in triathlon, also wants to show his worth while he has chance. The furthest he has run competitively is 10km and it is more than six years since he took the GB 10km title on the track in 27:51 at the joyously curated Night of the 10,000m PBs in London. </p>



<p>“I don’t really feel I have moved my running on over the last few years and 2025 is the year to do it,” Yee says, explaining his reasoning. “Having a run focus opened up the chance of running a marathon, and London is a special place for me. It’s a place that gave me so much as a child. London Marathon Day, especially, was such a big part of my life growing up, I have great memories of racing the mini-marathon for Lewisham and seeing the city come alive around the race. So it was a no-brainer.”</p>



<p>That’s where the smile will be even broader. Even as the race gets tough into the closing stages, the crowds lining the streets like no other marathon will save a special cheer for their local favourite. </p>



<p>The organisers are also relishing the first time an Olympic triathlon champion has started amongst the elite field, and distance running legend and four-time London winner, Eliud Kipchoge has stated he’d be happy to give Yee some advice. </p>



<p>Yee’s spectacular triumph on the Pont Alexandre III in Paris was also voted <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/yees-belief-shines-through-for-paris-gold"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Team GB’s Moment Of The Games</a></strong> and led to a worthy nomination for BBC Sports Personality of the Year (SPOTY). “It was a fantastic year and to finish it with SPOTY was a surreal experience,” he adds “It was an honour to have been shortlisted alongside some incredible names.”</p>

<p>Now it’s all about 26.2 miles, and a choice that makes sense. It’s four years until the Los Angeles Olympics and while that will fly by, racing triathlon around the globe, either on the World Triathlon Championship Series &#8211; where he became the <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/wtcs-grand-final-alex-yee-crowned-world-champion-after-finishing-third-in-nail-biting-tussle-in-southern-spain"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">first British men’s world champion</a></strong> for 12 years in October &#8211; autumn’s Supertri series, or even potentially the T100 World Tour, takes a toll. Now is a limited window to try something different in the knowledge that there’ll be no shortage of swim, bike and run offers when he returns.</p>



<p>Yee and his support team in Loughborough headed up by coach Adam Elliott are under no illusions at the size of the task, and while there was an element of tongue-in-cheek fun, Yee’s Strava post on January 17 titled ‘Yeah.. marathon is gonna be hard’ suggested the training is bringing that home.</p>



<p>In that session Yee ran 29km in 1hr 52min at an average pace of 3:52/km and quickened to 3min/km at peak &#8211; almost the exact <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/run-training/how-to-improve-your-triathlon-run-pace"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">pace</a></strong> he’ll need to run to hit the upper end of his target. It’s mind bogglingly fast to mortals, but while Yee is no ordinary athlete, some things about <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/run-training/how-to-run-your-first-marathon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">marathon training</a></strong> don’t differ: it’s about patience and managing risk.</p>

<p>“My training structure won’t actually change all that much,” he explains. “I’m still committed to developing as a triathlete over the longer term, so swimming and cycling will be part of my regular training throughout the week. However, there will be an obvious need to increase my run volume and do longer marathon-specific sessions.”</p>



<p>Training as a triathlete is another intriguing angle to this experiment. Such is the level at the top of triathlon, that Elliott believes cutting swimming and cycling out of the programme completely for four months could leave Yee having to play too much catch-up when he returns. </p>



<p>Particularly, when it comes to swimming, where, as the coach explains, he’s dedicated himself to the improvements to make the front pack. The other <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/the-best-cross-training-sports-for-triathlon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">benefit of cross-training</a></strong> is it reduces the risk of injury, particularly to the lower leg, if Yee tops out at around 130km per week rather than closer to 200km like most elite marathon training programmes.</p>



<p>Load is something that all athletes need to manage. Various studies have been undertaken to try and ascertain the extent of injuries in first-time marathon runners, and while the figures differ, data from a study on the New York City Marathon suggested one in ten runners (9.5%) picked up an injury serious enough to stop them starting or completing the race, and an additional 49.2% had minor injuries that interfere with training or performance.</p>

<p>“I don’t have any concerns around the marathon or the training, it’s actually very exciting,” Yee says. “And like I said, it’s all part of a bigger plan of being a better triathlete.” One benefit Yee has over amateur athletes is that he has a team monitoring his workload, alongside his own perception, which might be the most important factor. Coach Elliott will analyse the results of each session to see how he’s absorbing training. </p>



<p>For example, is Yee’s heart-rate too high for a particular pace? Or how are his lactate thresholds changing? Yee also has a partnership with COROS, whose <strong><a href=""https://coros.com/pacepro"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener nofollow"">Pace Pro</a></strong> <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/gear/tri-tech/multisport-watches/best-triathlon-watches-reviewed"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">multisport watch</a></strong> helps him monitor both his fitness and his freshness as well as everything else you’d expect from a sports watch. </p>



<p>“The first thing has always been how light in weight it is, I’m still surprised today, and often forget I’m wearing the thing 24/7,” he continues.</p>



<p>“Battery life and the COROS Training Hub are other standout features for me, being able to analyse the raw data after I train or perform in a race is particularly important. To see what’s been done has been really beneficial for my progress.”</p>

<p>Yee can also pair it with the <strong><a href=""https://uk.coros.com/heart-rate-monitor"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener nofollow"">COROS Heart Rate Monitor</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""https://uk.coros.com/dura"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener nofollow"">COROS Dura power meter</a></strong>. “As I mentioned, swimming and cycling will still form a large part of my training, and the COROS DURA is great when out on the bike and looking at power,” he explains. “When it comes to running though, I’ll focus on the usual three elements; pace, distance and heart-rate. I’ll make sure I wear my COROS heart-rate monitor as it means my data is more accurate, and checking my heart-rate is vital to ensure I’m staying in the right zones.”</p>



<p>One athlete who believes Yee can rise to the challenge is <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-tom-bishop"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Tom Bishop</a></strong>, one of the leading GB elite triathletes of the past decade, who is now mixing racing with coaching. “I’ve trained and raced with Alex since 2017 and have admired his rise to global success,” Bishop says. “It was clear from the first day I met him that this lad could run. </p>



<p>&#8220;But also his tenacity and determination were what truly struck me. These traits will see him thrive in the marathon world. With the expert team, training partners and mentors around him, I do not doubt that Emile Cairess’ British debutant record will be under threat.” </p>



<p>It’s jumping a long way ahead, but should Yee’s marathon debut go to plan, would he consider an audacious bid at doubling up for the triathlons AND marathon in Los Angeles 2028? While USA’s <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-taylor-knibb"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Taylor Knibb</a></strong> competed in both the cycling time-trial and triathlons in Paris, the attrition of Yee’s potential events &#8211; totalling over 54km of hard-running &#8211; is some ask. USA’s <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-morgan-pearson"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Morgan Pearson</a></strong> has also hinted he might attempt the triple.</p>

<p>Even if the athletes are game, so much depends on the schedule. While the LA28 format hadn’t been finalised, World Triathlon were among the sports lobbying to be one of the first medal events of the Games. While track and field is being flipped with swimming to feature in the first week, if the men&#8217;s marathon is held back until the final weekend, it would perhaps provide the only schedule where it could possibly be considered. </p>



<p>&#8220;There are lots of factors that would need to go into that decision but my focus for LA 2028 is firmly to be in the best shape possible to defend my triathlon title,&#8221; Yee says. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t considered anything else.&#8221; </p>



<p>Elliott is in agreement: &#8220;It would be incredibly challenging. Not going to say no, but it would be an immense challenge to race at the sharp end of both at the same time.&#8221; One thing Yee won&#8217;t be doing is getting too far ahead of himself. Even the rest of the eyes on London on April 29th and a fascinating race in prospect. </p>

<p>It will keep you focused throughout the winter months when it is more difficult to get out on your bike and could be used as a B race as you plan your<a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/long-distance/your-first-ironman-30-training-and-preparation-tips"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""> <strong>Ironman</strong> </a>preparations. Just give yourself enough time to recover from the marathon before you race again.</p>



<p>Additionally, all the hard work you’ve put in for the marathon build will set you up for a great run in a triathlon. The strength gained from the long run and marathon sessions will help to lift your goal pace for long-distance racing and you’ll have the confidence that you can get</p>

<p>Marathon training doesn&#8217;t all have to be running. Plan with your coach the key run sessions you have in a week, like a long run, marathon pace intervals and strength work. Then use your <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/recovery-sessions-what-are-they-how-to-do-them-and-what-are-their-benefits"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">recovery days</a></strong> to off-load the legs, like an easy swim or spin on the bike. Long rides will still give you the endurance fitness and physiological gains for the marathon. </p>



<p>Don&#8217;t forget to keep you swimming up as you enter the triathlon race season. It&#8217;s easy to neglect when focusing on a single discipline and you don&#8217;t want to lose all the gains you&#8217;ve made over the years. It doesn&#8217;t take many swims to retain the skills and fitness you have. </p>



<p>Also consider heading to the gym. <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/what-are-the-best-strength-training-exercises-for-triathletes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Get strong</a> </strong>and robust for the long hard runs you have, the last thing you want is to pick up an injury while preparing for a marathon before the season. </p>

<p>The T100 Triathlon World Tour is a race series that&#8217;s recognised by World Triathlon as the official world championship tour of long-distance triathlon.</p>



<p>Forty of the world’s best female and male pros (20 each gender) compete over nine races culminating in the T100 Grand Final in Qatar, in December.</p>



<p>For 2025, the top 10 of each gender from 2024’s T100 Tour rankings automatically received an invite to race (16 have taken up contracts). The remaining slots have been filled from the&nbsp;PTO World Rankings, reflective of outstanding performances in 2024.</p>



<p>Additional &#8216;Hot Shot&#8217; contracts have been allocated to &#8216;those athletes who’ve earned the right to race through Olympic success or their standing in the sport outside of their PTO World Ranking Position.&#8217;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then there are ‘Wildcard’ (non-contracted) athletes for each event. These are chosen based on exceptional recent performances, top athletes coming back from injury or maternity or more Olympians stepping up in distance. They can still earn prize money, points and the chance at a 2026 contract.</p>



<p>For a full run-down of who&#8217;s been given what contract, head <strong><a href=""/news/whos-racing-the-t100-triathlon-world-tour-this-year"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">here</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Athletes are racing for a hefty prize fund of $250,000 per event, with $25,000 awarded to first place, $16,000 to second place and $12,000 to third. Across the nine races that totals $2million of prize money.</p>



<p>There&#8217;ll also be a $200,000 prize for the series winners after the Grand Final, with other athletes also awarded money based on their ranking at the end of the series. This comes from an additional prize pool of $2million.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-how-does-the-t100-points-system-work"">How does the T100 points system work?</h3>



<p>Athletes score 35 points for first place to 1 point for 20th place at each of the nine races, which contribute towards their T100 &#8216;Race To Qatar&#8217; ranking.</p>



<p>The Qatar T100 Triathlon World Championship Final has increased points – 55pts down to 4pts.</p>



<p>Each athlete’s best four T100 race scores plus the Qatar T100 Triathlon World Championship Final will count towards the women’s and men’s T100 World Championship titles. </p>

<p>All eyes will be on reigning champion <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-marten-van-riel"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Marten Van Riel</a></strong> in Singapore, but he will have completed Ironman South Africa  just a week before in a bid to qualify for the Worlds in Nice in September. </p>



<p>Hoping to capitalise on some tired Belgian legs then will be none other than <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-hayden-wilde"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Hayden Wilde</a></strong>, the Olympic silver medallist, multiple WTCS winner and reigning supertri champion switching up to the 100K distance for 2025. </p>



<p>Defending Singapore T100 champion Youri Keulen (NED) will also be on the line, as will <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-jelle-geens"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jelle Geens</a></strong> who many believe is a dark horse for the world title having been <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/las-vegas-t100-jelle-geens-beats-marten-van-riel-in-battle-of-the-belgians"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">the only person to beat Van Riel over 100K</a></strong> last year.</p>



<p>Geens has already upset the American contingent by questioning the Hot Shot credentials of <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-morgan-pearson"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Morgan Pearson</a></strong>, who retorted to T100: “We’ve got that beef, everyone wants to see it, I guess.

<p><a href=""https://tri-today.com/2025/01/short-nails-no-watches-downgrade-in-drafting-penalties-and-new-mtr-order-new-rules-world-triathlon/"">The rules</a> where drafting results in shorter time penalties were much debated, yet Ironman sees merit in adopting those regulations from World Triathlon. Athletes mainly fear that this way &#8211; because of the shorter penalties &#8211; will encourage drafting. In an Ironman 70.3, drafting is penalized with only two minutes and in a IM 5150 with one minute.</p>



<p>Aerobars may not extend beyond the front part of the front wheel from now on. In addition, an athlete may still have a maximum of two liters of drinking bottles (or drinking system) on the front of the bike and a maximum of two water bottles with a total of 1 liter on the back of the saddle. Neoprene swim caps are now only allowed when swimming with wetsuits.</p>



<p>An overview of all rules can be found here.</p>

<p>For Heemeryck, this means he will pack his bags and head home early. “I had no chance and that&#8217;s a big disappointment because I was in a great shape. I biked on the same road all week to avoid accidents and then I end up getting mowed off the road on that very road, just two kilometers from my apartment. I went to the hospital, where they took pictures and determined that my collarbone is broken. I&#8217;m flying home today.”</p>



<p>The disappointment, of course, is enormous. “Don&#8217;t talk about it. I was really feeling good and ready for the race.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>This article has been updated to include the statement from the ITA.</em></p>



<p>Imogen Simmonds, the fourth place finisher at this year&#8217;s IRONMAN 70.3 World Championships, has been provisionally suspended for an anti-doping rule violation.</p>



<p>Simmonds was tested out-of-competition on December 8th, a little under a week before her fourth place at 70.3 Worlds in Taupō, New Zealand. Simmonds tested positive for a metabolite of ligandrol. Ligandrol is a selective androgen receptive modulator (SARM), and primarily used in a medical setting to prevent muscle wasting in hip fracture patients. It is also <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jbmr.3621#page=38"" title="""">known to improve lean muscle mass</a>. Ligandrol has been a prohibited substance under the WADA Code for nearly a decade as an other anabolic agent.</p>



<p>The International Testing Agency (ITA), which handles both testing and results management for IRONMAN, confirmed that both Simmonds&#8217; A and B samples were positive for SARMS LGD-4033 (ligandrol) metabolite Dihydroxy-LGD-4033. </p>



<p>In a statement, the ITA said, &#8220;The ITA confirms that a sample collected from Swiss triathlete Imogen Carlina Simmonds during an out-of-competition anti-doping control on 8 December 2024 has returned an adverse analytical finding for SARMS LGD-4033 (ligandrol) metabolite dihydroxy-LGD-4033, a non-specified substance prohibited at all times.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The athlete now has the opportunity to present her explanations for the result.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In accordance with the World Anti-Doping Code and Article 7.4.1 of the IRONMAN Anti-Doping Rules, the athlete is under provisional suspension. The athlete has the right to challenge the provisional suspension and ask for its lifting.&#8221;</p>



<p>Simmonds, in a statement posted to Instagram, denies intentionally taking the substance. Instead, she alleges that ligandrol entered her system &#8220;via the transfer of bodily fluid.&#8221; </p>



<p>&#8220;Through investigation and research, it was discovered that&#8230;my longtime partner had been ingesting ligandrol to help improve his own personal physique around the time of the positive test.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;considering the timeline of events: specifically, that I had a negative doping control test six days earlier and 22 days after, and that my partner and I engaged in intimate relations both the day of and day before my&#8230;doping control test &#8211; my legal team and I have concluded that this substance got into my system via the transfer of bodily fluid.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not the first time that a female athlete has tested positive for ligandrol or its metabolites and stated that it was the result of bodily fluid exchange.

According to the athlete, who says she had no idea how that substance got into her body and therefore initiated an investigation, it is because of her partner, who does use The post Imogen Simmonds tests positive in out-of-competition test, but points to partner appeared first on Triathlon Today .",https://tri-today.com/rss,"<p>Switzerland&#8217;s Imogen Simmonds tested positive for ligandrol; a substance that has similar effects to testosterone, in an out-of-competition doping test on Dec. 8, 2024. According to the athlete, who says she had no idea how that substance got into her body and therefore initiated an investigation, it is because of her partner, who does use ligandrol (without her knowledge, ed.).</p>



<p>The test was conducted unannounced and leading up to the Ironman 70.3 World Championships in Taupo, and Simmonds said she was stunned and devastated by the outcome. &#8220;I was stunned and devastated when the test came back positive for a metabolite of ligandrol at picogram levels (a quantity that is equivalent to a dash of salt in an Olympic-size swimming pool and would have never provided me with any performance-enhancing benefit). I had no idea what the substance was or how it could have got into my system. I had a negative doping control test six days earlier and 22 days after.&#8221;</p>



<p>Simmonds immediately sought assistance after the positive test, and after “research and investigation,” she found out that her partner, whom she married around the time of the positive test, did use ligandrol &#8216;to help improve his own personal physique around the time of the positive test&#8217;. &#8220;“I have an intimate relationship with my partner and my team and I came to the conclusion that the ligandrol must have entered my body through bodily fluids (such as saliva or semen, ed.),” she said. &#8220;My partner and I engaged in intimate relations both the day of and day before my 8 December 2024 doping control test – my legal team and I have concluded that this substance got into my system via the transfer of bodily fluid.&#8221;</p>



<p>Simmonds further indicated that she is not the first and undoubtedly not the last athlete in whom this happens. &#8220;so I hope my story can help raise awareness of this form of contamination.&#8221;</p>

(<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DD9mvSpt1Ny/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" title="""">Oh, there were some changes to his home life, too &#8211; he got married at the end of last year.</a>)</p>



<p>Bogen burst onto the world stage in 2023 when <a href=""https://slowtwitch.com/news/new-records-and-a-german-sweep-of-the-podium/"" title="""">he won the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship</a> (the youngest to ever win the title and leading a German sweep of the podium) in Lahti, Finland, but he&#8217;d set the stage for that big win with his victory over Patrick Lange at IRONMAN 70.3 Kraichgau earlier that season. </p>

<p>The 24-year-old grew up as a competitive swimmer, which has done him well during his triathlon career. When he realized as a U23 racer that he wasn&#8217;t likely to earn a spot on Germany&#8217;s Olympic team, he turned his sites to long-distance racing. Initially part of Ku Cycles&#8217; development team as an age-grouper, he made his pro debut in 2022 with a third-place finish at the Bilbao Triathlon. He took fourth at IRONMAN 70.3 Lanzarote at the beginning of 2023, signalling he was ready to race with the world&#8217;s best.</p>



<p>Bogen had a strong relationship with one of the founders of Ku Cycles, Alex Bok, who those who have been in the sport long enough will remember as one of the men behind Team TBB, the team coached by Brett Sutton that numerous big-name triathletes including four-time Kona champ Chrissie Wellington. Bok had helped Bogen connect with coach Jo Spindler in November, 2022. After Bogen&#8217;s win in Lahti, Ku announced &#8220;a long-term exclusive athlete management agreement.&#8221; In June of 2024 Saucony announced that Bogen would become &#8220;its newest elite athlete ambassador.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bogen enjoyed another successful year in 2024, finishing third at T100 San Francisco, second at the T100 Grand Final in Dubai and third overall in the T100 series. He wasn&#8217;t able to duplicate his 70.3 worlds success, though, taking seventh in Taupo last December.</p>



<p>News of the various changes Bogen is making in terms of training and sponsors began a few weeks ago. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFx-BMGtmKV/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" title="""">He announced that he would no longer be working with Ku or Spindler</a>. </p>



<p>&#8220;Since 2022, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ku_cycle/"">@ku_cycle</a> has been my steadfast companion—my first supporter in the middle distances who recognized my potential to become a world champion,&#8221; Bogen wrote on Instagram. &#8220;In 2023, together with my coach <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jo_spindler/"">@jo_spindler</a>, I achieved that dream, an incredible success we never imagined so early. Then, in 2024, by securing third place in the overall T100 season ranking, I affirmed my place among the world’s elite.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, we have mutually decided to part ways,&#8221; Bogen continued. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are proud to have played a part in Rico&#8217;s journey,&#8221; Ku posted in a video at about the same time. &#8220;Ku Cycle wishes Rico all the best in his future endeavours.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bogen also announced that he&#8217;s now part of the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF75pyzN82A/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" title="""">Erdinger Alkoholfrei Team</a> alongside IRONMAN world champ Patrick Lange. Shortly afterward that news was announced, we learned that he was training in St. Moritz <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGTin7ssEQ6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" title="""">with new coach Philip Seipp</a>, who is Nice world champion Laura Philipp&#8217;s husband and coach.  Yesterday we learned that he was joining &#8220;the Canyon family,&#8221; solving the mystery of which bike he would be riding this season.</p>

<p>Bogen has signed a contract with the Professional Triathletes Organisation (PTO) to compete on the T100 Triathlon World Tour for 2025, and will no-doubt look to try and earn another 70.3 world title in Marbella later this year. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see if the training and sponsor changes pay off.</p>

Not the best triathlete — although I do recall him saying that he once clocked 23 minutes for a 1500m swim, which most of us would jump at. Running was less his forte.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When he completed the London Marathon last year by unconventional means (which I’ll come on to), he joked that it was likely the fastest way he would ever tackle the streets of the capital. But still, he was the strongest. And over the past five years, that strength only grew.</p>

<p>When I first met 37-year-old Sam Perkins in 2019, he could hardly breathe. He’d only received the diagnosis of motor neurone disease (MND) a few months earlier, but his lungs had packed up first, and he was using a ventilator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time I saw him for the last time at the start of this year, watching his beloved Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup tie from a bedroom he’d not been well enough to leave for three months, he could no longer move, talk, or eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eye recognition software helped him type out messages, a common one being ‘suction’ to clear out saliva. Sam never underplayed how MND strips a person physically because, in understanding its cruelty, we should only strive harder for a cure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not that it had been an unproductive week for Sam. Two days earlier, a cheque had been dropped off for £5,000 for Sam’s charity, <strong><a href=""https://standagainstmnd.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Stand Against MND</a></strong>, which he founded upon diagnosis and which continues to raise hundreds of thousands to help fund research at the University of Nottingham. </p>

<p>Triathlon and endurance sport had been the hook for his fundraising, a metaphor for his resilience. Make no mistake: Sam was the driving force, often with a fierce will that overruled more sensible judgement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, he wanted to be towed around in a boat and on a bike at the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/sam-perkins-this-is-my-chance-to-take-part-in-triathlon-just-one-more-time"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Outlaw in Nottingham in 2020</strong></a>. The pandemic put it on hold, and by the time that goal was realised, it had been scaled back to the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/sam-perkins-completes-one-more-tri-with-motor-neuron-disease"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Outlaw Half in 2022</strong></a>, with Sam being pushed for the run leg. </p>



<p>Covered in issue 405 of the 220Triathlon magazine, the team he assembled —family, friends, Nottingham Forest players — speaks to the esteem in which he was held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not sated by that, he was offered the chance to take part as a wheelchair-assisted athlete in the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/ironman-champ-chrissie-wellington-to-support-mnd-athlete-sam-perkins-in-london-marathon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>2023 London Marathon</strong></a>, where a buckled wheel on the adapted chair ultimately led to aborting the attempt after 15 miles. </p>

<p>He convinced us it was a good idea. It was. The day ended in a craft brewery, where Sam had a few sips of ale for one of the final times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfinished business meant a return to the London Marathon last year — and redemption. By now, the team had spare wheels, spare ventilators, and a supporting pram full of medical supplies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The merry band of family, runners, and carers that accompanied him made for a weekend to cherish. Tears of frustration were swapped for tears of joy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the aftermath, Sam channelled his emotions into <strong><a href=""https://standagainstmnd.com/blogs/standing-against-mnd"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">blog posts</a></strong> on the charity website— worth a few minutes of your time. </p>



<p>When I saw Sam for the final time, in his room in East Leake, with the world smaller now, I was more awestruck by his strength of human spirit than at any time previously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may remember that in her pro career, Chrissie Wellington sought inspiration from Rudyard Kipling’s <em>If</em>. When I hear that poem now, it is these four lines that will always remind me of Sam:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew</p>



<p>To serve your turn long after they are gone</p>



<p>And so hold on when there is nothing in you</p>



<p>Except the Will which says to them:</p>

The Riel deal: From T100 triumph to a 2025 sequel?,https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/marten-van-riel-interview-2025,Liz Barrett,2025-02-20 10:19:48+00:00,"['Athletes', 'News']","{'@isPermaLink': 'false', '#text': 'https://www.220triathlon.com/?p=168303'}","He’s Belgium’s Mr Consistent, and after a triumphant season on the new T100 circuit is now considered one of the world’s top middle-distance athletes. We caught up with Marten Van Riel as he gears up for his toughest year yet…",https://www.220triathlon.com/news/rss,"<p><strong>The 2024 race season was <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-marten-van-riel"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Marten Van Riel</a>’s year. Or at least it was on the T100 circuit, where the Belgian pro proved his mastery over the 100km race format, winning three races and finishing a close second to take the inaugural title and the $210k champion’s cheque at the final race. </strong></p>



<p>The 32-year-old had less luck elsewhere, most notably at his third and final <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/yees-belief-shines-through-for-paris-gold"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Olympics in Paris</a></strong>. After a sixth-place finish in Rio and an agonising fourth in <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/mens-olympic-triathlon-alex-yee-wins-silver-in-tokyo"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Tokyo</strong></a>, he was hoping for another solid result. Twenty-second was the best he could do on an unusual day for the sport that would propel him into the limelight in a way which he’d never imagined (more later). </p>



<p>And then there was Ironman Cozumel at the end of the year, where Van Riel (MVR) hoped to qualify for his first Worlds, just seven days after his T100 series victory. But after leading until 175km on the bike, Van Riel hit a pothole, swerved into the side of the road and hit a little girl who was spectating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Van Riel, despite suffering an elbow injury, completed the race but finished seventh, two places shy of Nice qualification. Luckily, after a trip to the local hospital, the girl was treated for a cut finger and took photos with Van Riel, who gave her his finisher’s medal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hoping for a more settled year, Van Riel knows he’ll also have his work cut out as a raft of big names joins the T100 roster for 2025. </p>



<p>But for now we find him in Girona, where he trains with Glenn Poleunis’s PTC Coaching outfit, as he reflects on that tumultuous 2024 and plans ahead for what promises to be another scintillating season…</p>

What are you hoping to learn from the Olympic champion?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>Yeah, it’s a really cool opportunity for all of us in the group to level up to the professionalism [that she brings]. It’s interesting seeing how all these athletes deal with being at that level and everything that comes with it. </p>



<p>I personally struggle sometimes to find some kind of stability in my life, so this is something that I think I can learn a lot from Cassandra.</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">

</ul>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-your-2024-was-also-incredibly-successful-and-you-would-have-had-a-clean-sweep-in-the-t100-were-it-not-for-your-compatriot-jelle-geens-won-lake-las-vegas-does-that-still-niggle""><strong>220: Your 2024 was also incredibly successful. And you would have had a clean sweep in the T100 were it not for your compatriot [Jelle Geens won Lake Las Vegas]. Does that still niggle?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR:</strong> Ha! Yeah, it stings a little but Jelle is a good friend of mine so I’m also happy for him. It was maybe also in a way good because I was getting a bit focused on that winning streak. </p>



<p>I knew that I was going to get beaten at some point, and that ‘loss’ gave me some more freedom, because while I don’t really care to lose a race, it’s sometimes also important. </p>



<p>And it was still a really good step towards the overall title, because with T100 it’s about who can be the most consistent over the year. And if you look at the field for next year, I hope, well unless it’s myself, I hope no one’s going to clean-sweep the whole series!</p>



<ul class=""wp-block-list"">

</ul>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-in-that-field-who-keeps-you-awake-at-night""><strong>220: In that field, who keeps you awake at night?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>I think the main guy will probably be <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-hayden-wilde"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Hayden</a> </strong>[Wilde]. At this distance, it’s getting harder to drop people on the swim because no one’s taking it out like they do in short course. </p>



<p>So Hayden is always going to be close and I think he’s shown that on the bike. And especially with some of the big firepower missing, like [Magnus] <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-magnus-ditlev"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Ditlev</strong></a>, which is something that I could always take advantage of, now maybe I’m gonna have to be the one that’s gonna push the bike. </p>



<p>And then on the run, Hayden did it [dropped back after a strong start] in Paris and again in Taupo [the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/ironman-70-3-world-championships-stacked-fields-as-worlds-best-head-to-taupo"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>2024 70.3 Worlds</strong></a>], but he’s going to get it right at some point and it’s going to be very hard for me to beat him on the run. And Jelle is also very, very fast, but I feel that’s very doable for me.</p>

<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-you-started-last-year-s-series-on-a-level-playing-ground-but-you-go-into-it-this-year-with-the-target-on-your-back-how-does-that-sit-with-you""><strong>220: You started last year’s series on a level playing ground, but you go into it this year with the target on your back. How does that sit with you?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>The level was always going to go up this year because last year there were a lot of Ironman guys who were really high in the PTO rankings, really good, solid athletes, but they were never going to be competitive in T100. </p>



<p>Maybe less than half the actual contracted field was actually competitive, whereas I think that this year nearly all of them are going to be competitive. So I know that everyone wants to take my title, but I just have to try and focus on myself.</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-you-did-four-out-of-the-six-t100-races-last-year-so-what-s-your-plan-this-year""><strong>220: You did four out of the six T100 races last year, so what’s your plan this year?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>We’re contracted to do five out of the 10 races [full schedule still to be announced], so I probably need to do seven to be competitive. </p>



<p>I’m going to do the first four and then if it goes really well in the beginning of the year, maybe I can scrap some of the races at the end and race something else.</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-and-are-you-still-hoping-to-qualify-for-the-ironman-worlds-in-nice""><strong>220: And are you still hoping to qualify for the Ironman Worlds in Nice?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR:</strong> Yes, I’m going to do Ironman South Africa at the end of March, which is a little bit complicated because we have to do Singapore T100 as part of our contract, which is the weekend after. It’s one of the races that I wanted to skip, so I might not have ‘it’ in Singapore. </p>



<p>But again, that’s the good thing about not having that winning streak anymore, I can be more comfortable with that. So I’m doing a bit more <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/long-distance/how-to-race-your-first-ironman"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Ironman preparation</strong></a> now and then also again after the French Riviera T100 [end of June], if I’m qualified.</p>

<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-what-was-your-t100-race-highlight-from-last-year-and-why""><strong>220: What was your T100 race highlight from last year and why?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR:</strong> <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/t100-san-francisco-van-riel-wins-epic-sprint-as-knibb-cruises-to-comfortable-win"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>San Francisco</strong></a>. I was the most unprepared there, which is why it makes me very happy that I could take the win. I’d done some Olympic qualification races just before it, so I had to travel a lot. </p>



<p>Afterwards I was thinking like, damn, that’s actually great that I pulled that off! I’ve raced<strong> <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/who-is-kyle-smith"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Kyle</a></strong> [Smith, who he narrowly beat at the tape] and Rico [Bogen, who came a close third] a lot more since and you can’t underestimate those guys. </p>



<p>And that race has always been on my bucket list since I was a kid reading 220! Escape from Alcatraz was mythical, it’s different from any other triathlon, so to be able to take my biggest ever win there, was amazing.</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-you-said-after-the-paris-games-that-you-didn-t-have-an-explanation-for-your-performance-six-months-on-do-you-have-one-now""><strong>220: You said after the Paris Games that you didn’t have an explanation for your performance. Six months on, do you have one now?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>Yeah, I still don’t really have an explanation to be honest. I think that maybe I did let myself go a little bit too much when they postponed the date, because I’ve heard some athletes say that they were prepared for it. And I 100% wasn’t. </p>



<p>I did not think that that was going to happen. Then I posted something on that day [about his disappointment with the organisers], that got a lot of people sending me messages, media from all over the world were contacting me, and I think that I just lost my focus. Other than that, I’m still not really sure because I think my run was in the best shape that it’s ever been. </p>



<p>It probably still wasn’t enough to beat <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-alex-yee"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>Alex</strong></a> [Yee] or Hayden, but I think we also saw on that day that even they were vulnerable on the run. </p>



<p>But yeah, during my career I’ve always been so consistent and I don’t have many performances that I kind of don’t know why. Unfortunately this one, yeah, still no idea really.</p>

<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-does-that-mean-there-s-unfinished-business""><strong>220: Does that mean there’s unfinished business?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR: </strong>Ha, no! When you come fourth it’s very hard to not want to come back. So maybe that’s the good thing about not coming fourth, fifth or sixth, now I’m kind of over it and I want to make a name in long distance. </p>



<p>It also just suits me a lot more. I still love the sport as much as when I was 18, before I was a pro. So I hope that I can still go for another eight to 10 years.</p>



<h4 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-220-what-are-your-thoughts-now-on-how-the-olympic-triathlons-were-managed""><strong>220: What are your thoughts now on how the Olympic triathlons were managed?</strong></h4>



<p><strong>MVR:</strong> I still think it’s very bad. In the end, the Olympic triathlon was a big success, and we saw way more interesting races then maybe I also expected. </p>



<p>The very strong current made the swim more decisive, because the swim just doesn’t break packs up anymore, whereas here it did. </p>



<p>But yeah everything around it, for me, that was a very bad experience. And one of our girls got sick, Claire Michel, so we didn’t race the mixed team relay. </p>



<p>I don’t even know if it was because of the river, because only a handful of people got sick. But I think the biggest thing was just the fact that they [the organisers] didn’t really seem to care. ‘Oh we’ll just do it the day later.’ </p>



<p>We’ve been training four years for this, and we’ve probably trained 5,000 hours of which probably 1,500 are swimming. They really can’t have that happen again because it just makes a joke out of the athletes.</p>

<p>&#8220;On June 29th, 2020 my life changed forever. While walking into my barbershop for a routine haircut, I was shot three times in a drive-by shooting. The night of the shooting I was given a 50/50 shot to make it through the night because of the blood loss. I was told even if I did make it, the odds were high they would need to amputate my leg.  </p>

<p>&#8220;My doctors told me I’d never walk or run properly again. A neurologist even said I’d never run a <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/run-training/how-to-run-your-first-marathon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">marathon</a></strong>—so I ran a <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/run-training/whats-a-good-half-marathon-time"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>half-marathon</strong> </a>right after that appointment. Humans are capable of far more than we give ourselves credit for.</p>



<p>&#8220;After being shot, I leaned on my friends. They didn’t coddle me, they held me accountable and inspired me to grow. Surrounding yourself with people who genuinely want to see you thrive can change your life.</p>

<p>&#8220;<strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/how-to-train-for-your-first-triathlon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Triathlon training</a></strong> constantly reminds me what I’m capable of and pushes me to keep striving for more. Training for three disciplines keeps things exciting, even if it’s not necessarily easier on my body. I’ve never been a <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/swim-training/what-makes-triathlons-strongest-swimmers-so-fast"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">strong swimmer</a></strong>, and until late November, I hadn’t learned to swim properly. Tackling something new and challenging is incredibly rewarding.</p>



<p>&#8220;Without big goals, I lack discipline. Ironman training forces me to improve not just in fitness but also in time management, which positively impacts my work, relationships, and overall life.</p>



<p>&#8220;I chose <strong>Ironman</strong> because it is coming to my hometown, Ottawa—the place where I was born, raised, and shot. After the shooting, I vowed to run a marathon despite nearly losing my right leg. </p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image size-large""><img decoding=""async"" src=""data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="" data-src=""https://www.220triathlon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/Brandon-peacock-ironman.jpg?w=576"" alt=""brandon peacock stands with triathlon bike in cycling kit"" class=""lazyload wp-image-168172"" /><noscript><img decoding=""async"" src=""https://www.220triathlon.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/02/Brandon-peacock-ironman.jpg?w=576"" alt=""brandon peacock stands with triathlon bike in cycling kit"" class=""lazyload wp-image-168172"" /></noscript><figcaption class=""wp-element-caption"">Credit : Brandon Peacock</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;I trained for my first two marathons on the same course Ironman will use. It’s where I rebuilt my confidence, made lifelong friends, and became the person I am today. </p>



<p>&#8220;My goal is to raise $200,000 for trauma survivors, giving back to the community that shaped me. My best friend, a physiotherapist, is the reason I’m able to train for this Ironman today. </p>



<p>&#8220;He spent 3–5 hours a day with me, not just helping me heal, but making me stronger than ever. This effort is an homage to him and a way to ensure others have access to the same quality care.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that with the right resources and care, many individuals who end up on lifelong disability support could instead find their new 100%. I want to be part of that change.</p>



<p>&#8220;The <strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/beginners/what-are-the-benefits-of-triathlon"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">triathlon community</a></strong> is incredibly supportive. I’ve had famous athletes, influencers, and world champions reach out with advice and encouragement. It’s truly a one-of-a-kind tribe where everyone wants to see each other succeed. </p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone has a story. Whether it’s overcoming trauma like me, or simply a drive to be extraordinary, it’s inspiring to be surrounded by people chasing something bigger than themselves.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can’t control what happens to you, but you can control how you respond. I couldn’t control whether I survived the night I was shot, but I could control my recovery. </p>



<p>&#8220;By focusing on rebuilding myself <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/training/what-are-the-best-strength-training-exercises-for-triathletes"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>stronger</strong> </a>and using my story for good, I not only healed but gave hope to my family and friends during a difficult time. Taking accountability for my healing allowed us all to move forward without being weighed down by bitterness or regret.&#8221; </p>

<p>The Olympic and world champions’ hopes looked to be dashed early as they struggled at the rear of the field halfway through the second leg.</p>



<p>But a bike crash that took out Great Britain’s Max Stapley, along with Portugal’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-vasco-vilaca"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Vasco Vilaca</a> and Switzerland’s Simon Westermann, helped bring them back into contention before a stellar final leg from Henry Graf sealed the win.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-morgan-pearson"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Morgan Pearson</a> brought the USA in for second place, and 20-year-old Euan De Nigro rounded out the podium for Italy.</p>



<p>It was an unfortunate end to British hopes after Beth Cook had put them in a strong position on the first leg, and then Stapley, alongside the powerful Vilaca, looked set to capitalise on the advantage.</p>



<p>Yet, when Westermann slid out on a corner, bringing down another three of the leading five, everything changed — including putting the Swiss, Portuguese and Brits out of the race.</p>



<p>There were already no French, Australians or New Zealanders competing, but following entertaining <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/wtcs-abu-dhabi-lisa-tertsch-leads-german-women-podium-sweep"">women’s </a>and <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/wtcs-abu-dhabi-hayden-wilde-powers-to-victory-in-season-opener"">men’s races</a> the previous day, 11 nations did line up, including <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/olympics/paris-triathlon-team-germany-win-gold-in-the-mixed-team-relay-as-team-gb-take-bronze"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">all three Olympic medallists</a>: Germany, USA and Great Britain.</p>



<p>With only one other mixed team relay competition taking place in this year’s World Triathlon Championship Series, in Hamburg in July, it provided a rare opportunity for athletes to show their mettle over the super-sprint format.</p>



<p>While the distances stayed the same, in a change to the ordering for the next four years, the men reverted to competing on the anchor leg, as was the case up to and including the Tokyo Olympics.</p>



<p>The Germans, who also defended their mixed team relay world title in 2024 and had won the <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/olympics/team-germany-win-the-paris-olympics-mixed-relay-test-event"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Paris Olympics relay test event</a> the year before, weren’t alone in fielding a novice quartet.</p>



<p>Portugal was one of the few to buck that trend, fielding three of the Paris Olympic team, including Vilaca and Ricardo Batista, who had already shown they were in good form, having finished third and sixth in the individual event.</p>



<p>Britain’s four were led off by Cook, followed by Stapley, with both Isobella Hayes and Hugo Milner unable to take part after Stapley crashed out.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-leg-1"">What happened on Leg 1?</h3>



<p>If any reminder was needed of how fast the racing is, Belgium’s Jolien Vermeylen led out the opening 300m swim in a touch over four minutes.</p>



<p>Britain’s Cook, daughter of 1989 world championship runner-up Glenn Cook and multiple European champion Sarah Coope, was in close attendance in transition, and a leading group of five quickly formed for the 7km bike leg.</p>



<p>USA’s Taylor Spivey, who was 13th in the individual race in Abu Dhabi, took over the lead for the more technical sections, but with half the chasers catching on, it left the Dutch, Germans and Irish a few seconds adrift.</p>



<p>There was little to split the field as they headed out onto the 2km run, with the biggest surprise being that Germany’s Selina Klamt was dropping further and further behind.</p>



<p>Vermeylen and Spain’s Anna Godoy were first to hand over, with the top eight within 20sec, but the Germans 43sec back and, along with Ireland and Japan, looking almost out of contention.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-leg-2"">What happened on Leg 2?</h3>



<p>Stapley brought the Brits back into the lead with a typically strong swim and set off on the bike with the talented Vilaca, Netherlands’ Mitch Kolkmann, Switzerland’s Westermann and Spain’s David Cantero.</p>



<p>Just as the breakaway looked as if it might be race-defining, there was another twist as news filtered through of 10-second penalties for both the Portuguese and the Spanish.</p>



<p>Disaster then struck the lead group just before they hit the athletics track, as on a painted section of road, Westermann slid out at the front, bringing down three of the other front five, leaving only Cantero still riding.</p>



<p>Kolkmann remounted to haul in the Spaniard and fly past, but it was race over for Westermann, Stapley and Vilaca.</p>



<p>USA, Belgium and Italy all came into transition 30sec behind, with Germany, Japan and Ireland another 20 sec in arrears as the gaps started to close.</p>



<p>Cantero reeled Kolkmann in halfway through the run, tagging Miriam Casillas for the third leg with the Spanish in with a chance of a rare podium finish.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-leg-3"">What happened on Leg 3?</h3>



<p>There were 55sec covering the remaining eight nations as the relay passed its midpoint, with Netherlands’ Luna De Bruin bridging up to Casillas at the front of the swim.</p>



<p>The Italians had Bianca Seregni, who led out the previous day’s swim in the individual event, on the third leg, which helped close up the race once more as they headed out on the bikes.</p>



<p>USA’s Erika Ackerlund and Belgium’s Nele Dequae were working together in third and fourth to try to keep the front pair in sight, and there was a similar gap back to the four chasers: Italy, Germany, Japan and Ireland.</p>



<p>Irish triathlete Hollie Elliott, who had recently switched from GB, lost a chunk of time towards the end of the bike leg, which looked to have ended her nation’s chances.</p>



<p>Casillas was sharpest away on the run and decided to use her advantage to serve the outstanding 10sec penalty, rejoining the race in third place and leaving Germany’s Tanja Neubert in the lead.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-leg-4"">What happened on Leg 4?</h3>



<p>Henry Graf had a 9sec advantage over USA’s Morgan Pearson for the final leg, with Italy’s Euan De Nigro, Spain’s Roberto Sanchez Mantecon and Netherlands’ Gjalt Panjer in pursuit.</p>



<p>Graf extended the lead by another 4sec after the swim and had a decision to make — whether to go all-out on the bike or save his energy, knowing there was likely to be a chasing pack of four, including the fast-running Pearson.</p>



<p>The German had no intention of sitting up and continued to build a gap as he started the final bike lap. Unrest was setting in over sharing the workload to hunt Graf down, and as he headed onto the run, the lead looked unassailable.</p>



<p>While the gap came down over the final stage, Graf rarely looked in danger, and Pearson eased clear of De Nigro, with Sanchez Mantecon just missing out on the podium.</p>

WTCS Abu Dhabi: Hayden Wilde powers to victory in season opener,https://www.220triathlon.com/news/wtcs-abu-dhabi-hayden-wilde-powers-to-victory-in-season-opener,Tim Heming,2025-02-15 13:27:31+00:00,News,"{'@isPermaLink': 'false', '#text': 'https://www.220triathlon.com/?p=168060'}","The Kiwi took the first race of the seven-event series, but there was a promising WTCS debut for GB’s Ben Dijkstra, who held on for eighth place",https://www.220triathlon.com/news/rss,"<p><strong><a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-hayden-wilde"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Hayden Wilde</a> continued from where he left off in the World Triathlon Championship Series, as the New Zealander took top spot in the first event of the season in Abu Dhabi.</strong></p>



<p>Wilde, who picked up Olympic silver in Paris and then won the WTCS Championship Finals in Spain, kicked away from Australia’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-matt-hauser"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Matt Hauser</a> in the closing stages over the sprint distance in the Middle East.</p>



<p>Portugal’s <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-vasco-vilaca"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Vasco Vilaca</a> grabbed a hard-earned third place, with Britain’s Ben Dijkstra, on his WTCS debut, finishing eighth, Max Stapley, 11th, and Harry Leleu 15th.</p>



<p>After a cancellation on the eve of last year’s competition due to an impending storm, the triathletes were just pleased to get racing on a typically hot day in the Middle East.</p>



<p>While Abu Dhabi has become the traditional curtain-raiser for the season for the past decade, a February race was a month earlier than usual &#8211; and the earliest that a WTCS event has ever been scheduled.</p>



<p>With the next event not being until May in Japan, it meant several of the big names were missing including reigning world champion <a href=""https://www.220triathlon.com/news/athletes/who-is-alex-yee"">Alex Yee </a>&#8211; who was concentrating on his London Marathon preparations for April &#8211; and the French contingent of 2022 and 2023 world champs, Leo Bergere and Dorian Coninx.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-in-the-swim"">What happened in the swim?</h3>



<p>Olympic silver medallist Wilde was ranked No 1 of the starters and was a clear favourite for victory.</p>



<p>But next best in the 2024 rankings, Australia’s Hauser, is a renowned swimmer, and the Gold Coast native was very familiar with the beach start format adopted in the Middle East.</p>



<p>As such, Hauser led the swim from the hooter, with a line of athletes content to swim in his wake starting with Brazil’s Miguel Hidalgo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hauser, who crashed out of last year’s WTCS finals in Spain, produced a rare sub-8min swim, with Hidalgo following and then Portugal’s Miguel Tiago Silva and Germany’s Henry Graf.</p>



<p>The best placed Brits out of the water were Dijkstra (9th), Leleu (11th) and Stapley (15th). Wilde was 32nd out of the water, 29sec behind.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-the-bike"">What happened on the bike?</h3>



<p>The pace was on from the start with the front group of 16, including the leading three Brits, making a small gap of 6sec on the chasers led by Wilde.</p>



<p>The wind was fierce in places, buffeting them as they rode over the short bridge section, and then pushing them to more than 50km/h as they headed back towards the athletics track.</p>



<p>By the time they completed the second lap, the main groups were back together, but Wilde wasn’t content to let that be the end of the action.</p>



<p>The Kiwi continued to try and forge a break at the front and in Switzerland’s Simon Westermann and Austria’s Tjebbe Kaindl found two willing accomplices.</p>



<p>Heading onto the final lap the leading trio had established a gap that only served to give them a clearer run into the second transition as the main group dismounted within seconds of one another.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-what-happened-on-the-run"">What happened on the run?</h3>



<p>A group of five set about making the pace on the first of the two laps for the 5km run. Hauser, Wilde, Vilaca were all present along with Netherlands’ Mitch Kolkmann and Canada’s Charles Paquet.</p>



<p>Kolkmann and Paquet were quickly jettisoned, and Vilaca, who placed fifth in the Paris Olympics, dropped off towards the end of the first lap.</p>



<p>Wilde and Hauser took turns at the front as they approached the closing stages, but it always looked likely that Wilde would go through the gears at some stage, and when he did, Hauser couldn’t quite match it.</p>



<p>Dijkstra was a few seconds away from fourth place, but eventually had to settle for eighth, with Stapley and Leleu also having decent showings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t Hugo Milner’s day though. Having lost touch on the bike, the fast-running Milner finished in 31st place and just over 2min off the pace.</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-wilde-said"">Wilde said:</h3>



<p>“It feels like this is my second home as I’ve been here three-to-four weeks and have been loving it. We got a breakaway [on the bike], it didn’t stick, but we had fun out there. I’ve raced Matt over 5km many times and I knew for sure he had one more push. He was coming hot, and I was happy to hold on. I don’t know how many World Series I&#8217;ll do, but it was nice to win here for the first time. T100 is up next in Singapore, so I’m looking forward to racing the long course boys.”</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-hauser-said"">Hauser said:</h3>



<p>“It’s always tough getting second, especially when you’re there the whole way. I kept saying to myself: ‘Stay in the game!’ There were a few tactics and games [from Wilde] but I managed to hold on for second. I can’t wait for the next one, and I’m looking forward to the World Championship Finals and hopefully bringing it home on home soil.”</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"" id=""h-vilaca-said"">Vilaca said:</h3>



<p>“I’m very happy with third place. It’s the first race of the session, and a&nbsp; great start. These guys made me suffer today and I think the legs have woken up and are ready to get into 2025. I loved the course. The F1 course is legendary but this whole island is beautiful and I’m stoked to be here. Now it’s time to put some good work in for Yokohama.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Continuing to test its </span><b><i>T100</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> stars in environments that offer different terrains and conditions, the professional course will start with a 2km sea swim in Mediterranean waters off Figueretas Beach, with 2 laps around off-shore buoys before heading back to the beach and T1.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The 80km pro bike course will be made up of 3 laps: two of 31km &#8211; including a 3.1km link from T1 &#8211; that takes the athletes across to Santa Eulalia City and back, before a final lap of 14.9km. There will be a testing mix of climbs, technical sections and head-down TT sections, before a fast and flat run with 7 laps of a 2.57km course around the historic Ibiza Old Town. Weaving into the World Heritage area of the city before finishing on the Port front. To see the pro course, visit the </span><b><i>T100</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> website </span><a href=""https://t100triathlon.com/ibiza/pro/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Age Groupers taking on the 100km challenge will face a similar challenge, starting with a 2km loop around the island “Illa de Ses Rates”. The bike course takes a slightly different route across the island compared to the professionals, consisting of 3 laps of 25km with a 2.3km link from T1 and back to T2, before concluding the race on a similar run course. See it </span><a href=""https://t100triathlon.com/ibiza/participate/100km-open/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As well as the professional and amateur 100km triathlon, the PTO has also introduced a range of open water sea swims &#8211; in keeping with its desire to encourage and cater for participants of all abilities and make the most of the idyllic surroundings. More details of further amateaur races will be released soon.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“We are excited to announce these courses,” said Sam Renouf, CEO of the PTO, who have continued to work closely with both the Spanish Triathlon Federation (FETRI) and Ibiza to build on last year’s successful event. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“We had stellar start lists in Ibiza last year with three Olympic champions &#8211; Jan Frodeno (2008), Alistair Brownlee (2012 &amp; 2016) and Kristian Blummenfelt (2020) &#8211; taking part in the men’s race, and then all of the world’s top 10 PTO-ranked female athletes. But we expect the athlete start lists this year to be even stronger, due to the contracted </span><b><i>T100</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> athletes who will need to join the start line in this fifth race of the new </span><b><i>T100 </i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">series. For example, the appearance of Spanish superstar Javier Gómez Noya will be very much anticipated by a fervent home crowd.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Responding on behalf of FETRI, its president </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">José </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hidalgo said: “In the Spanish Triathlon Federation we are very pleased to continue our partnership with the PTO and hold their new </span><b><i>T100</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> races in Ibiza and also include our Middle Distance Spanish Cup at the 100km distance.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The amateur 100km race over the weekend will include two fields. An Open event that anyone can race in, and then the Middle Distance Spanish Cup for Elite and Age Group categories, which includes a prize fund of more than €15,000 for the top individual finishers as well as for the best represented clubs.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are limited places left for all the amateur events due to high demand</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, so you’re encouraged to register as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p>The Australian star, who is now three-from-three at PTO Tour events this year – and $245,000 richer because of it – overtook home-country hope Taylor Knibb in the closing stages to secure another incredible victory. In doing so, Gentle has confirmed her status as the world&#8217;s preeminent 100km racer.</p>



<p>You can <a href=""https://plus.protriathletes.org/video/394736/pto-us-open--womens-race-replay"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">watch the full replay of the women&#8217;s race now on PTO+</a> in all territories outside Europe and the Indian Subcontinent, where it will be available 48-hours after the race ended.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">PTO US Open – How It Played Out</h2>



<p>As predicted, Lucy Charles-Barclay was soon at the front in the water, Taylor Knibb the only athlete to stick on her feet. With the rest of the field strung out behind them, the Brit and American came out of the water for the mid-way Australian exit with a lead of 31 seconds to a group including Holly Lawrence, Ashleigh Gentle, Flora Duffy, Paula Findlay and Lisa Norden.</p>



<p>By the end of the swim, that lead had only increased, with Charles-Barclay and Knibb leaving the water in 27:01 (1:21/100m) one minute ahead of the chasers. Charles-Barclay stole a march of around 15 seconds on Knibb through T1 while the chase pack was led onto the seven-lap bike course by Holly Lawrence, 1:05 after Knibb.</p>



<p>At around 8km into the 80km course, Knibb surged past Charles-Barclay and began to put time into everyone on the course. During lap two, Charles-Barclay, who had already lost her race nutrition bottle from the rear of her bike, had a brief stop to address an issue with her electronic shifting, which had apparently overheated under the Texan sun.</p>



<p>By halfway through the bike, Knibb’s buffer was 1:51 to Charles-Barclay. In turn, the Brit had a 1:12 gap to the four chasers who’d detached themselves from the rest: Holly Lawrence, Paula Findlay, Flora Duffy and Lisa Norden, some 3:03 off the leader.</p>



<p>By the start of the final lap, Knibb’s lead was up to 3:04, Charles-Barclay holding steady at 2:08 ahead of the chase pack and losing a more time – now 5:13 behind Knibb. Meanwhile PTO Canadian Open winner Ashleigh Gentle was leading the second chase group, 6:19 from the front and 1:06 from the podium contenders ahead.</p>



<p>Showing no sign of weakness, Knibb pushed on to T2 and after a controlled transition, started the 18km, five-lap run with a lead of 3:42 to Lucy Charles-Barclay. 2:25 later (6:07 behind Knibb), Findlay, Duffy, Lawrence and Norden began the run shoulder to shoulder. However, it wasn’t long before Duffy, the double Commonwealth Champion upped the pace to take a clear third place on the course.</p>



<p>Ashleigh Gentle, eighth off the bike and 6:52 off the lead, stormed onto the final leg, quickly establishing herself as the fastest runner on the course. Soon, Duffy faltered while the Australian seemed unphased by the heat overtaking within the first 5km.</p>



<p>From there, Gentle continued to hunt her prey, overcoming her deficit to Lucy Charles-Barclay by 10km. Initially, it seemed the Aussie would run out of road to catch Knibb, but the American was reduced to a walk over a couple of short sections as the conditions took their toll.</p>



<p>Making the pass just before the 16km mark, Gentle had 2km of running to soak up the fact she would be taking a second consecutive PTO Open victory worth another $100,000. She crossed the line in 3:37:17 after a 1:04:59 run, which was four minutes faster than any other woman.</p>



<p>Knibb held on for second and $70,000 with a 3:38:32 finish while Lucy Charles-Barclay completed the podium in 3:40:31 to earn $50,000.</p>



<p>Holly Lawrence paced herself perfectly to stay in the hunt for big money, coming fourth in 3:43:37 to claim $40,000. Lisa Norden’s 3:44:49 finish was worth $35,000, the Swede pipping Olympic Champion Flora Duffy to round out the top five.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Podium Quotes</h2>



<p>“I’m getting all emotional now,” said a jubilant Ashleigh Gentle. “It’s been a really good year &#8211; it’s been a lot of fun. I’ve definitely been enjoying the sport again. Thanks to the PTO for putting this on and giving us triathletes the opportunity to race these world-class events against world-class athletes. It’s a privilege to be here and I am just absolutely in shock.” </p>



<p>On the race in the Texan heat, the PTO World #6 said: “I had to dig to the depths of myself for that one &#8211; that was really, really tough.  Seeing the group ride away was a little depressing but I just tried to keep my head in the game and hope that I could run into a good position. I absolutely did not expect to have run into the win.</p>



<p>“I’ve been telling myself the last couple of days that it is not that hot but it is very hot and I just tried to manage my pacing well. I guess it paid off.”</p>



<p>Second-place finisher, Taylor Knibb, the PTO World #7, was in pole position for much of the race and takes home $70,000. The 24-year-old American said: “I&#8217;m just so grateful to go to get to the finish line. I don&#8217;t know how I made it… I was just dying, overheating. I couldn&#8217;t move any faster. Like that was. I don&#8217;t know how I made the finish line. And that&#8217;s pretty much all I can say.”</p>



<p>The third-place getter, Lucy Charles-Barclay, was first out the water, hung tough on the bike, and ran strongly to take the final podium position and $50,000. The British star and PTO World #5 said: “That was absolutely brutal out there. And to anyone who is finishing this in these conditions, these ladies are just hard as nails. That was incredibly tough conditions to overcome. And yeah, I&#8217;m just happy to make the finish line, to be fair.</p>



<p>“I had my fair share of nightmares out there. Unfortunately, I was stuck in the hardest gear for the first two laps. I think the battery must have died or overheated and the mechanic gave me a new battery. Once we got that sorted, I felt up and running, but I had lost my nutrition… this is not the environment where you want to lose your nutrition. So I just had to keep my head, try and get as much nutrition on board and tough it out on that bike psychologically.<br><br>“I had to dig deep and find something. I mean, I&#8217;ve trained incredibly hard. So, you know, this is the moment that you&#8217;ve been working for. And when things don&#8217;t go quite right, you&#8217;ve just got to tough it out. And I think I&#8217;ve gained a lot just from overcoming those things going into my next races.”</p>

<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jackson Laundry</a> (PTO World #15) is another class performer in Dallas with something to prove. Having started the year strong – beating Lionel Sanders, Rudy Von Berg and Alistair Brownlee at 70.3 Oceanside – the Canadian didn’t show his true potential at either the PTO Canadian Open (19th) or the Collins Cup. After two sub-par performances, which Laundry admitted stung him, look for a big comeback at the PTO US Open.</p>

That said, he’s another athlete who struggled at the PTO Canadian Open (28th) and came last in his match-up at the Collins Cup. That was against PTO World #1 Kristian Blummenfelt and Olympic Bronze medallist Hayden Wilde though, so he was certainly an underdog there and that could help him fly under the radar in Dallas.</p>

<p>In the Collins Cup battle between Team Europe, Team US and Team International, it was the defending champions from Europe who prevailed on home soil. Winning eight of the 12 match-ups, Team Europe proved the continue to rule the sport of triathlon while a strong Team International passed the ignominious Broken Spokes trophy to Team US.</p>



<p>Team Europe got off to a stellar start with PTO World #1 Daniela Ryf, who, after racing while suffering shingles last, had the performance she was truly capable of to seal the fastest women’s time of the day, beating Olympic Champion Flora Duffy in the process.</p>



<p>Another key match-up was Kristian Blummenfelt’s domination – the <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/rankings/men"">PTO World #1</a> and Olympic, World Triathlon and Ironman World Champion adding the fastest time at the Collins Cup to his resume.</p>



<p>Much of the talk in the build-up to the 2022 edition of the Collins Cup race centred on the exchanges between Team Europe’s Sam Laidlow and Team US’s Sam Long – who had agreed to disagree as pre-match exchanges <a href=""https://twitter.com/protriorg/status/1560941328191594498?s=20&amp;t=qBQ62namFxGKD5J2mA5HzA"">reached boiling point</a> following the event&#8217;s Opening Ceremony.</p>



<p>That match provided compelling viewing as Sanders and Long wiped out a huge swim deficit to Laidlow on the bike before sealing the European&#8217;s fate on the run. From there, it was an epic shoulder-to-shoulder battle that could only be decided by an all-out sprint to the finish in which Sanders clinched victory for Team International.</p>



<p>The final scores were 53 for Team Europe, 38 for Team International and 22.5 for Team US. Team Europe took eight of 12 match wins with Team International coming first in the other four, meaning Team US failed to win a single match.</p>



<p>The 12 match-ups went head-to-head-to-head over 100km – a 2km swim, 80km bike and 18km run. Here is a rundown of how it played out in Samorin along with key quotes from the finish line.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 1</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Daniela Ryf (EUR) vs Sarah True (US) vs Flora Duffy (INT)</strong></p>



<p>After initially holding onto Flora Duffy’s feet, Daniela Ryf and Sarah True were left to swim together as Duffy motored away. That equalled a 25-second lead to Ryf and True out the water, a lead that extended to over 30 seconds thanks to Duffy’s swift transition.</p>



<p>Soon Ryf had Duffy in her sights while True couldn’t hold with the pace of the Team Europe athlete. By halfway through the bike leg, in classic Ryf style, the Swiss Miss was 1:39 ahead of the Olympic Champion with Sarah True almost three minutes behind. Ryf’s charge continued unchallenged, the <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/rankings/women"">PTO World #1</a> creating a seemingly insurmountable buffer of 5:37 to Duffy and 6:48 to True.</p>



<p>While Duffy did bite some time from her deficit at first, Ryf remained incredibly strong to win in 3:28:50, some 6:58 ahead of Duffy and 11:30 ahead of True to claim a full six points.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 1 / INT – 3</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Daniela Ryf</strong></p>



<p>“It feels really amazing to be coming back after last year I could perform well in all three and feel like I&#8217;m a complete athlete again. When I got to the last km I heard it was 5s over 5 min so I pushed as hard as I could to try to get the max 6 points.</p>



<p>“Last year I raced while I was sick. I had blisters all over my legs, I had shingles and you obviously can&#8217;t race like that. This morning I went for a jog and my heart rate was about 30 beats lower than last year.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 2</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Laura Philipp (EUR) vs Chelsea Sodaro (US) vs Ashleigh Gentle (INT)</strong></p>



<p>Mirroring Match 1, Ashleigh Gentle took the lead in the water with Chelsea Sodaro and Laura Philip tucked in closely behind. It wasn’t long before the Australian pulled ahead to create a margin of just over a minute after the 2km was done.</p>



<p>Philip had closed the gap to 40 seconds by 40km in, with Sodaro 3:12 behind. The German soon made the junction to Gentle and took the lead going on to press her advantage to 54 seconds by T2. Sodaro meanwhile was struggling at 10 minutes off the pace.</p>



<p>Gentle, winner of the recent PTO Canadian Open, quickly ran down the German and took back her lead. From there it was plain sailing for the Australian, going on to win in 3:30:51. Laura Philip managed to keep her deficit to 2:32 while Sodaro was over 15-minutes back.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 3.5 / US – 1 / INT – 5</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 3</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Kat Matthews (EUR) vs Sky Moench (US) vs Paula Findlay (INT)</strong></p>



<p>With Paula Findlay swimming to the front, Team International were once again leading in Match 3. The Canadian managed to eke out 21 seconds to Kat Matthews and a minute to Sky Moench. Findlay wasted no time on two wheels – piling on the pressure to create a gap to the chasers.</p>



<p>By halfway, Findlay had a lead of 2:03 to Matthews, who had Moench right behind her. That buffer continued to grow, Findlay running out of T2 with 4:22 in hand to Moench and 5:24 to Matthews, who appeared to be having less than her usual bike strength.</p>



<p>Findlay remained super strong throughout the 18km run to take the tape in 3:31:10, taking maximum points with a 6:46 lead to Matthews and 7:30 to Moench.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 2 / US – 1 / INT – 6</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 4</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Nicola Spirig (EUR) vs Sophie Watts (US) vs Vittoria Lopes (INT)</strong></p>



<p>With Lopes’ swimming pedigree, there was no doubt it would be pole position once again for Team International in the swim. The Brazilian came into T1 with a 25-second lead to double-Olympic medallist Nicola Spirig with Sophie Watts over two minutes behind.</p>



<p>In her last international triathlon competition, Nicola Spirig showed she wasn’t here to make up the numbers by charging to the front of her match and taking a lead of 2:24 to Lopes by halfway and 4:03 to Watts.</p>



<p>The Swiss superstar reached T2 with a lead of 4:49 to Watts and didn’t let up for a moment, rounding off her international career with a sensational win some 16:32 ahead of Lopes. Meanwhile, Watts was forced to withdraw.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 1 / INT – 3.5</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Nicola Spirig</strong></p>



<p>“I was pretty nervous. I felt pretty good but didn’t know what to expect. I had the extra pressure from the team. I was nervous but came out of the water and was 25 seconds behind Lopes and knew I could make that.</p>



<p>“I was really keen to show I was the right pick and I deserved the spot and I’m really happy I’ve helped the team to have a good performance.</p>



<p>“I’m just happy to have a good performance in my last international race and it’s nice to go out like that.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 5</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Holly Lawrence (EUR) vs Jocelyn McCauley (US) vs Ellie Salthouse (INT)</strong></p>



<p>Team Europe were first out of the water in Match 5, Holly Lawrence leading but with Team International’s Ellie Salthouse just six seconds behind. Team US’s Jocelyn McCauley – the second-fastest biker here last year – was only 1:04 down. The American continued to make inroads and took the lead just after the halfway mark. Lawrence managed to stick closely to McCauley, the pair dropping Salthouse convincingly.</p>



<p>Once on the run, it was Lawrence’s day. The Brit ruled the run to cross the line in 3:33:10, 4:33 ahead of McCauley and a massive 13:18 ahead of Salthouse, who had a tough race but pushed on to the end.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 5.5 / US – 3.5 / INT – 1</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 6</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Anne Haug (EUR) vs Jackie Hering (US) vs Tamara Jewett (INT)</strong></p>



<p>In perhaps one of the most evenly-weighted match-ups, there was nothing to separate Anne Haug, Jackie Hering and Tamara Jewett out of the water. That status quo remained throughout the bike, all three women entering transition within 15 seconds of one another.</p>



<p>From there Haug steadily moved away over the 18km, proving herself the sport’s best runner once again to cross the line in 3:33:57, 1:44 ahead of Jewett and 5:23 ahead of Hering.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 4 / US – 1 / INT – 2.5</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Anne Haug</strong></p>



<p>“My main goal was to stick with the girls on the swim because I’m with them in T1 then everything is in my hands and it was. Jackie did a great job on the bike until the turning point and then I took control and then just wanted to run fast.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 7</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Kristian Blummenfelt (EUR) vs Ben Kanute (US) vs Hayden Wilde (INT)</strong></p>



<p>With an expectation that Team US’s Ben Kanute would lead from the water, it was a little surprising to see Hayden Wilde right behind him and Olympic Champion Kristian Blummenfelt just five seconds behind.</p>



<p>While Kanute initially pushed the pace on the bike, he was never out of sight of his competitors. Blummenfelt took the lead around 50km in and didn’t look back, reaching T2 with a 1:45 buffer to Kanute and 5:05 for Wilde. Keeping the pressure on during the run leg, Blummenfelt’s lead ballooned while Wilde tracked down Kanute to move into second at around 8km in.</p>



<p>The Olympic Champion, Ironman World Champion and World Triathlon Champion stormed to victory in 3:09:19 setting a benchmark for the other men to follow. Wilde was over eight minutes behind with Kanute nearly 12 minutes back.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 1 / INT – 2.5</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Kristian Blummenfelt</strong></p>



<p>“It’s tough to come from sprint distance to 100km but I knew that Hayden was one of the ones who could do it. That’s why I stayed behind until 50km or so on the bike because that’s when it starts to get hard and was super stoked with my run legs.</p>



<p>“The support out on the course was giving me a little bit more energy and it’s such a great place.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 8</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Sam Laidlow (EUR) vs Sam Long (US) vs Lionel Sanders (INT)</strong></p>



<p>In a match that had courted controversy before even a toe was dipped in the water. Team Europe’s Sam Laidlow went out fast to immediately distance Sam Long and Lionel Sanders, scything through the water to create a lead of 3:17 after the 2km swim.</p>



<p>By halfway into the 80km bike, Laidlow was 2:37 ahead of Sanders who was sitting just in front of Long, the pair switching turns through. By 53km, the Frenchman’s lead was down to just 1:33 and still narrowing. By T2, Sanders and Long had Laidlow in their sights and indeed pushed past him in the first kilometer. From there Long and Sanders were running shoulder to shoulder as Laidlow was eventually forced to walk, clutching his stomach.</p>



<p>Long surged around halfway through the run to create a gap, but the elastic never truly snapped with Sanders getting back up to the American. In the end, it was a sprint finish between the pair that decided the match, Sanders outpacing Long as they entered the stadium to clinch the match in 3:12:25, Long just two seconds back.</p>



<p>Laidlow would eventually finish nearly 30 minutes behind, helped along by match 11’s Gustav Iden.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 1 / US – 3.5 / INT – 4.5</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Lionel Sanders</strong></p>



<p>“Not bad for a couple of duathletes! It was deeply personal for me too. I told Sam, let’s put this guy in his place. I like Sam Laidlow but I think it got too personal, so I think we were on the same team on this one.</p>



<p>“This is totally next level. We were both here last year and it’s going in the right direction and we’re showing the world and people are excited about it.”</p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Sam Long</strong></p>



<p>“I had absolutely no option but to back this up. The song in my head was Aretha Franklin R. E. S. P. E. C. T. When Lionel and I are working together the strategy is to inflict as much pain on each other as possible.</p>



<p>“Better just to do what you got to do and get the job done.</p>



<p>“I think he learnt his lesson here and think some respect is due but the race is done, we’ll have a beer and we’ll become friends and Sam will have to buy all of the rounds!”</p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Sam Laidlow</strong></p>



<p>“I knew I’d come out with a lead on the swim but I got onto the bike and my stomach wasn’t taking on any nutrition. I don’t want to make excuses but it just wasn’t my day. Once I stopped for the toilet four or five times, towards the end I started to feel OK again so there’s still hope I guess!</p>



<p>“They beat me and were better today. There will be other races. I can’t predict how I would have done it if it wasn’t for that, they were just better guys today. I&#8217;m definitely hungry to have another shot, it’s just fuel to the fire. I’ll be back.</p>



<p>“I appreciated that [the embrace] and their respect. They’ve got more experience than me and achieved a lot more, so it was nice to share some kind words even after my failure.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 9</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Magnus Ditlev (EUR) vs Rudy Von Berg (US) vs Max Neumann (INT)</strong></p>



<p>It was no surprise to see Aussie Max Neumann lead from the water with Team US’s Rudy Von Berg right behind. What was a surprise was the stellar swim of Team Europe’s Magnus Ditlev, the Danish superstar just 18-seconds adrift.</p>



<p>Ditlev was in the lead by 20km into the bike and had built a gap of 1:26 by halfway to Von Berg and 3:38 to Neumann. The Dane’s advantage was 3:49 at the start of the run, a lead that would only grow. By 9km in, Ditlev was over five minutes clear of the American with Neumann struggling more than 12 minutes back.</p>



<p>Continuing to stride towards the finish, Ditlev crossed the line in 3:13:31, taking maximum points 7:20 ahead of Von Berg and 11:20 ahead of Neumann.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 3 / INT – 1</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 10</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Patrick Lange (EUR) vs Jason West (US) vs Aaron Royle (INT)</strong></p>



<p>Aaron Royle was another Team International athlete to create a gap in the water, the Aussie besting Patrick Lange and Jason West by nearly two-and-a-half minutes. By halfway, that lead was still holding at 2:39 to Lange (who had a 10-second penalty due to crossing the bike mount line early) and 3:28 to West.</p>



<p>By T2, Royle had edged out his lead to Lange while West lost more time, coming off the bike more than six minutes down. Showcasing the talent that had bagged him a Captains’ Pick for Team International, Royle cruised ahead while Lange suffered, West gaining moving to second after halfway.</p>



<p>Royle stormed to a powerful win in 3:17:30, 4:52 ahead of West with Lange bringing it in – Team Europe’s victory confirmed – 6:24 behind.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 1 / US – 2 / INT – 5.5</em></p>



<p><strong>Key Quote: Aaron Royle</strong></p>



<p>“I think especially for me I prefer a bit of a dynamic course where there are some hills so it made for a really hard day. I knew I had to swim hard which I did and when I put myself in that position I knew there’s no looking back now. At times it’s just playing with your mind that you’re starting to slow down or they’ll start catching you. And thinking they are catching you when you turn around on those long straights and seem closer than they are.”</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 11</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Gustav Iden (EUR) vs Matt Hanson (US) vs Jackson Laundry (INT)</strong></p>



<p>Gustav Iden and Matt Hanson were neck and neck in the water, keeping Team US in the game. Meanwhile, Jackson Laundry was 1:27 behind – a rare slower swim for Team International. It didn’t take long for Iden to assert his dominance – 1:23 ahead at 20km, 2:21 at 40km and 4:57 by the dismount line.</p>



<p>On the run, he was imperious, his natural running style propelling him to maximum points. Along the way, Iden collected fellow Team Europe member Sam Laidlow, who’d rallied to hold with the Norwegian’s pace.</p>



<p>Iden took the tape in 3:11:32, the winning streak of his lucky hat intact, 7:46 ahead of Hanson and 21:16 ahead of Laundry, who fought valiantly to reach the finish line.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 3.5 / INT – 1</em></p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Match 12</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Daniel Baekkegard (EUR) vs Chris Leiferman (US) vs Braden Currie (INT)</strong></p>



<p>True to form, Daniel Baekkegard put in a storming swim to give himself an advantage of 42 seconds to Braden Currie and 3:01 to Chris Leiferman.</p>



<p>From there, it was a solo day for the Dane, who ripped through the bike course to extend his advantage to 5:14 and 9:12 on the Team International and Team US athletes respectively.</p>



<p>There was no way back for Baekkegard’s competitors during the 18km run as the Team Europe athlete didn’t let up for a second to ensure maximum points in the final match. Baekkegard crossed the finish line to close out the Collins Cup in 3:13:52, 7:48 ahead of Currie and 10:49 clear of Leiferman.</p>



<p><em>Score: EUR – 6 / US – 1 / INT – 2.5</em></p>

<p>The inaugural PTO Canadian Open promised to take the sport to the next level and just as with <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/news/ashleigh-gentle-wins-pto-candian-open/"">the women&#8217;s race</a>, the men&#8217;s event delivered all the action, thrills and emotion to take triathlon up a notch. With a $1m prize purse and $100,000 on the line for the winner, it was a hotly fought contest with the world&#8217;s best athletes fighting it out for victory.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">How It Played Out</h2>



<p>Henri Schoeman – a wildcard entry to this race making a bid for a Collins Cup slot – quickly formed the point of the spear in the swim. The South African broke away to lead a pack of six including Australian wildcard <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/aaron-royle"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Aaron Royle</a> (PTO World #100), the USA’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-kanute"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ben Kanute</a> (PTO World #18), GBR’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/alistair-brownlee"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Alistair Brownlee</a>, France’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-laidlow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Sam Laidlow</a> (PTO World #20) and New Zealand’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kyle-smith"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Kyle Smith</a> (PTO World #25).</p>



<p>Pre-race favourites <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kristian-blummenfelt"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Kristian Blummenfelt</a> (PTO World #1) and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Gustav Iden</a> (PTO World #3) were in the second pack, over a minute behind by the end of the swim along with <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/frederic-funk"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Frederic Funk</a> (PTO World #28). Meanwhile, Canadian favourite <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Lionel Sanders</a> mounted his bike with 4:06 to make up, having been dropped in the swim and putting in the day’s slowest transition.</p>



<p>Brownlee quickly found the front on the bike and began putting the chasers under pressure with Sam Laidlow the only athlete to hold with the Brit. By halfway on the bike, Laidlow and Brownlee had a lead of 47 seconds to Smith with Iden and Blummenfelt now sat in fourth and fifth at 1:32 back, beginning to eat into their deficit. Sanders had lost more time at 4:13 but having moved up from 34th to 20th on the course.</p>



<p>Iden continued to push the pedals hard in the bike’s closing stages, reducing the deficit to the leaders to 1:02 as he ran out of transition having brought Blummenfelt and Funk along for the ride, with Royle another 20 seconds back in sixth and Sanders in 11th with 3:19 to make up.</p>



<p>Laidlow began the run at a ferocious pace, immediately dropping the British double-Olympic champion. Behind, Iden and Blummenfelt were running shoulder-to-shoulder taking chunks of time out of the leaders. Before long, Alistair Brownlee was reduced to a walk as he grimaced holding his sides. The Yorkshireman would battle gamely on but end the day in 24th place.</p>



<p>After the Norwegian pair overtook Laidlow, the drama continued as early in the second lap as Blummentfelt suddenly stopped running holding a cramp in his hip. He would get going again but the world number one would lose around 1:30 to his countryman in the process.</p>



<p>Then, another victim of cramp – Laidlow was forced to hobble to the nearest Precision Fuel and Hydration station before being able to pick the pace up again.</p>



<p>Coming onto the final lap, Iden remained in the lead but a recovered Blummenfelt was running quicker, steadily closing the gap. Royle was in third, three minutes down, with Laidlow in fourth and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/pieter-heemeryck"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Pieter Heemeryck</a> in fifth ahead of Funk. Meanwhile, Sanders, off the bike in 11th, was up to seventh.</p>



<p>Hitting the finishing straight, Iden broke into a smile, high-fiving fans to take the tape only to collapse exhausted to the ground, $100,000 richer and the first-ever PTO Canadian Open Champion.</p>



<p>Blummenfelt was second, only 27 seconds behind – securing $70,000 and a Norwegian one-two. Aaron Royle took third and a $50,000 paycheck – a big statement to the Team Internationals Collins Cup captains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laidlow hung tough for fourth and $40,000 while Funk’s late surge put him in fifth to take $35,000 ahead of Heemeryck’s sixth-place, $30,000 finish – all three attention-grabbing performances making selection tough for the Team Europe Collins Cup captains.</p>



<p>Sanders finished the day in seventh place, battling on through a less-than-perfect day to take home $25,000.</p>

The post Ashleigh Gentle Wins PTO Candian Open appeared first on PTO .",https://protriathletes.org/news/rss,"<p>Australia&#8217;s Ashleigh Gentle wins the PTO Canadian Open to claim $100,000 ahead of Canada&#8217;s Paula Findlay and the USA&#8217;s Chelsea Sodaro.</p>



<p>With one of the strongest women&#8217;s fields ever assembled, the PTO Canadian Open promised stellar performances and didn&#8217;t disappoint with Paula Findlay dominating the bike and Ashleigh Gentle smashing the run to take the tape ahead of the Canadian. Meanwhile, Chelsea Sodaro finished strong in a tightly-fought battle to claim the final podium spot.</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">How It Played Out</h2>



<p>In the swim, Vittoria Lopes quickly found the front, creating a gap on the second pack including Sarah Perez Sala (PTO World #22), Lauren Brandon (PTO World #53), Julie Derron (World #48) and Ashleigh Gentle (PTO World #17).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continuing to push the swim hard, Lopes had a significant lead but accidentally cut one of the swim buoys meaning she incurred a 30 second penalty. Even so, the Brazilian had clear water behind her and headed onto the bike and out of transition in pole position after a 27:26 swim.</p>



<p>By the end of lap one on the bike, Paula Findlay (PTO World #10) had moved from 10th to second with Lopes in sight. Findlay, recent winner of the Canadian National Time Trial Championships, was soon leading and pushing hard to distance all competitors.</p>



<p>With 40km done, Findlay came through transition with a smile, her lead was 1:06 to Gentle, Ellie Salthouse (PTO World #23), Nicola Spirig (PTO World #15) and Lopes. Further back, PTO World #8 Emma Pallant-Browne, a pre-race favourite, was forced out of the race with a front flat tyre. Meanwhile, Jocelyn McCauley (PTO World #21) was riding alone 2:08 back with Laura Philipp (PTO World #3) at 2:40 behind Findlay.</p>



<p>By the end of lap three, Findlay was enjoying a lead of 1:34 to the same pack of chasers, McCauley and Philipp losing a few more seconds. As she returned to a cheering crowd at the end of the 80km bike course, the Canadian’s buffer was up to two minutes over Jocelyn McCauley, who bossed the bike to reach T2 in second.</p>



<p>Over the four-lap 18km run, Findlay held a strong pace but Ashleigh Gentle – in second by 1.3km – was the fastest mover on the course. While Findlay wasn’t slowing, Gentle was on a flyer catching the Canadian around 7km in.</p>



<p>Behind, Laura Philipp was up into third place but looked to be working hard. Meanwhile, Chelsea Sodaro (PTO World #20), 10th off the bike, was ripping through the field and came right up to Philipp’s shoulder by 14km in.</p>



<p>Gentle, looking imperious, continued to drive her advantage, coming home in 3:30:53 with a 1:03:17 run – the day’s fastest – to become the inaugural PTO Canadian Open Champion and claim the $100,000 first-place prize purse. Starting the race as PTO World #17, this historic win is sure to boost her standing and secure an automatic qualification spot on Team Internationals for the Collins Cup, which is set for 20 August in Slovakia.</p>



<p>Feeding off the home crowd, Findlay finished second in 3:33:16, high-fiving the roaring fans to secure second place and take $70,000 – far more than the win in virtually any other race. In doing so, the Canadian secured the one-two for Team Internationals – hinting that they could pose a bigger threat at this year&#8217;s Collins Cup than in 2021, when the team received the Broken Spoke for coming third.</p>



<p>In the final 500m, Sodaro put her track-running background to great effect in breaking away from Philipp to take the final podium spot in 3:34:56 and a cheque for $50,000. That superb run performance from the Team US athlete should also worry Team Europe at the Collins Cup!</p>



<p>Philipp finished fourth to earn $40,000 while short-course star Julie Derron came fifth – throwing her hat in the ring for a Team Europe Captains’ Pick at the Collins Cup and taking away $35,000.</p>

<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Pro Women On The Race</h2>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Ashleigh Gentle</h3>



<p>&#8220;I just had the most amazing day today,&#8221; said Gentle. &#8220;It hasn’t been the easiest two or three years and I’m just grateful for all of the people that kept believing in me. I’m really proud of myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn’t start the sport of triathlon because of money but I have bills to pay, I’m an adult and the opportunity that the PTO has given us here is one I’m incredibly grateful for.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Paula Findlay</h3>



<p>&#8220;Honestly racing at home I was more nervous than I’ve ever been, more nervous than the Olympics or anything because I had all this support behind me and I didn’t want to disappoint anyone,&#8221; said Findlay.</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew I was fit, I knew I was healthy but you never know what’s going to happen on the day… of course I wanted to win, but there couldn’t be a more deserving champion. Ash is such a classy runner and I’m just so happy I could hold on for second.</p>



<p>&#8220;Seeing all my family and friends on the course and my mom – putting this race on and how much work she’s done just to get all this together – is amazing. So thanks to Do North for setting this up and just having a safe race, PTO for putting this on – it’s such an honour to race at home and I had the most fun ever.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">Chelsea Sodaro</h3>



<p>&#8220;For context, I have really struggled with my mental health, actually, since having my daughter 16 months ago,&#8221; said Sodaro. &#8220;I keep on thinking, ‘I’m good!’ and then I have these little moments where I realise I am human and it’s still something that I need to work on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I had a full-blown panic attack during the first lap of the swim. I seriously contemplated dropping out during that lap and then I was like, ‘Just make it another lap, just make it another lap.’&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Sodaro’s run that really made the difference today. &#8220;This is the first time honestly I have felt like myself since giving birth while running. I used to be a pretty good runner and I just think it’s finally coming back so I am truly shocked that I am on the podium today… I hope that I made my little baby super proud today.&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking about her motherhood and the PTO Maternity Policy, Sodaro added: &#8220;I found out about the maternity policy when I was five or six months pregnant… it actually made me quite emotional because it’s 2022 but we still have so far to go in the way that we support women.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But this initiative – it says that the PTO cares about women, it cares about female athletes, it cares about keeping us in the sport and seeing us through all the phases of our athletic career… Women peak in our mid to late 30s in this long stuff and so we need the opportunity to be able to stay in the sport and we shouldn’t have to choose between being world-class athletes and being moms – we can do both, we just need some support.&#8221;</p>

As well as deep competition with one of the best fields we’ve ever seen lining up, the race course itself will add a huge challenge on the bike once the athletes leave the water after 2km in Hawrelak Park Lake. Technical with four laps featuring tight turns, sharp climbs and fast descents, there isn’t a moment of let-up or the chance for athletes to get their heads down over the 80km course. On the run, it’s four laps again, the mixed terrain and wooded setting providing a beautifully fast finish.  The men’s race has an abundance of talent, all striving to clinch the first PTO Tour title in history. Here’s a run-down of some of the highest-ranked athletes to watch out for.  PTO World #1 Kristian Blummenfelt has almost conquered triathlon in just two seasons. The Olympic Champion, IM world champ and World Triathlon Champion will be seeking to add the PTO Canadian Open to his prestigious palmares.  Fellow Norwegian Gustav Iden (PTO World #3) is likely to be Blummenfelt’s biggest competition. The two-time 70.3 world champion and PTO 2020 Championship winner is undefeated at middle distance racing. “It’s not like you forget you’re friends out there,” said Iden of his training partner during the press conference. “But I think the will to win is quite strong in both of us. So I don’t think we’ll give each other too much slack towards the end of the race. I guess, at the start, maybe, but when things get really tough towards the last few Ks of the run, I think all logic just goes out the window and you just want to finish first.”  Lionel ‘No Limits’ Sanders (PTO World #5) might be Canadian but he trains ‘Norwegian style’ under coach Mikal Iden (brother of Gustav). He was clear what beating Iden and Blummenfelt would mean to him: “These guys to my right – and Brownlee as well, obviously – are the best guys in the world, truly. So it would mean more than anything I’ve accomplished in my career, most definitely.  “It’s not that fun finishing second, I’ve got lots of seconds. I would like to be gunning for the win so there’s only one way to do it and it’s to absolutely destroy the bike. Yes the back-half of the run gets extremely painful because of it, but that’s part of the game plan.”  Matt Hanson moved up to PTO World #10 after a sensation race at IM Des Moines where the US athlete showed he could bike with the best of them, taking the day’s fastest split. Add in the astonishing run pace he showed at the PTO 2020 Championship and Hanson is not one to be underestimated.  Jackson Laundry (PTO World #17) will be wanting to take the top spot and beat fellow Canadian Sanders into the bargain. He’s already achieved that feat once this season at 70.3 Oceanside, so the rest of the field is sure to watch him closely in this home-soil race.  Ben Kanute (PTO World #18) is one of the sport’s most versatile athletes and is sure to feature throughout the day. A veteran of World Triathlon competition – and the technical ability that goes with it – the course could suit Kanute perfectly making him a real threat.  The depth of field far from stops there with up-and-comer Sam Laidlow (PTO World #20) knocking on the door of a world-beating performance, plus the triple threat from down under of Australia’s Max Neumann (PTO World #23), Sam Appleton (PTO World #24) and Kiwi (PTO World #25).  While he’s not highly ranked right now having not raced for a while, no-one will be underestimating double Olympic Champion Alistair Brownlee, who was a late entrant to the event. “I feel healthy, although maybe not that fit,” said Brownlee. “I’m absolutely delighted to be here. I’m happy to be injury free and looking forward to racing as hard as I can and just enjoying it. I also think it’s a great opportunity to support this first event of the PTO Tour, which I think is a fantastic project and I felt like it was important to be here from that aspect as well.  “I’ve been a triathlete since I was eight years old and when I was 16 I remember [being] sat in a careers class in school… you’re going along the table: I want to be a brain surgeon, I want to be a lawyer or whatever, and I said, ‘I want to be a professional triathlete,’ and the teacher said, ‘Is that even possible, boy?’ And I said, ‘I don’t know to be honest but I’m going to give it a go.  “Nearly 20 years later, I have managed to be a professional triathlete. But still, I think there’s a long way that triathlon can go in terms of commercialising the sport and providing opportunities for exposure and earning for elite athletes, especially in the long-distance side of it. There are some phenomenal athletes and I think there are great stories to be told, there are great athletes to watch and for fans to follow and there needs to be a format to do that. I think the PTO is bringing that and pushing up every other organisation’s game around it.”"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Race Week video series</a> – for the winner it’s 100k for $100k.</p>

<p>Fellow Norwegian <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Gustav Iden</a> (PTO World #3) is likely to be Blummenfelt’s biggest competition. The two-time 70.3 world champion and PTO 2020 Championship winner is undefeated at middle distance racing. “It’s not like you forget you’re friends out there,” said Iden of his training partner during the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pMgHX5GM4g"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">press conference</a>. “But I think the will to win is quite strong in both of us. So I don’t think we’ll give each other too much slack towards the end of the race. I guess, at the start, maybe, but when things get really tough towards the last few Ks of the run, I think all logic just goes out the window and you just want to finish first.”</p>



<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Lionel ‘No Limits’ Sanders</a> (PTO World #5) might be Canadian but he trains ‘Norwegian style’ under coach Mikal Iden (brother of Gustav). He was clear what beating Iden and Blummenfelt would mean to him: “These guys to my right – and Brownlee as well, obviously – are the best guys in the world, truly. So it would mean more than anything I’ve accomplished in my career, most definitely.</p>



<p>“It’s not that fun finishing second, I’ve got lots of seconds. I would like to be gunning for the win so there’s only one way to do it and it’s to absolutely destroy the bike. Yes the back-half of the run gets extremely painful because of it, but that’s part of the game plan.”</p>



<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/matt-hanson"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Matt Hanson</a> moved up to PTO World #10 after a sensation race at IM Des Moines where the US athlete showed he could bike with the best of them, taking the day’s fastest split. Add in the astonishing run pace he showed at the PTO 2020 Championship and Hanson is not one to be underestimated.</p>



<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jackson Laundry</a> (PTO World #17) will be wanting to take the top spot and beat fellow Canadian Sanders into the bargain. He’s already achieved that feat once this season at 70.3 Oceanside, so the rest of the field is sure to watch him closely in this home-soil race.</p>



<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-kanute"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ben Kanute</a> (PTO World #18) is one of the sport’s most versatile athletes and is sure to feature throughout the day. A veteran of World Triathlon competition – and the technical ability that goes with it – the course could suit Kanute perfectly making him a real threat.</p>



<p>The depth of field far from stops there with up-and-comer <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-laidlow"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Sam Laidlow</a> (PTO World #20) knocking on the door of a world-beating performance, plus the triple threat from down under of Australia’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/max-neumann"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Max Neumann</a> (PTO World #23), <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-appleton"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Sam Appleton</a> (PTO World #24) and Kiwi <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kyle-smith"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Kyle Smith</a> (PTO World #25).</p>



<p>Viewers should also keep an eye out for South Africa&#8217;s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/henri-schoeman"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Henri Schoeman</a> – an all-around star with a super swim who&#8217;s also an Olympic medallist.</p>



<p>While he’s not highly ranked right now having not raced for a while, no-one will be underestimating double Olympic Champion <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/alistair-brownlee"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Alistair Brownlee</a>, who was a late entrant to the event. “I feel healthy, although maybe not that fit,” said Brownlee. “I’m absolutely delighted to be here. I’m happy to be injury free and looking forward to racing as hard as I can and just enjoying it. I also think it’s a great opportunity to support this first event of the PTO Tour, which I think is a fantastic project and I felt like it was important to be here from that aspect as well.</p>



<p>“I’ve been a triathlete since I was eight years old and when I was 16 I remember [being] sat in a careers class in school… you’re going along the table: I want to be a brain surgeon, I want to be a lawyer or whatever, and I said, ‘I want to be a professional triathlete,’ and the teacher said, ‘Is that even possible, boy?’ And I said, ‘I don’t know to be honest but I’m going to give it a go.</p>



<p>“Nearly 20 years later, I have managed to be a professional triathlete. But still, I think there’s a long way that triathlon can go in terms of commercialising the sport and providing opportunities for exposure and earning for elite athletes, especially in the long-distance side of it. There are some phenomenal athletes and I think there are great stories to be told, there are great athletes to watch and for fans to follow and there needs to be a format to do that. I think the PTO is bringing that and pushing up every other organisation’s game around it.”</p>



<p>That covers just a few of the men lining up in Edmonton with plenty more who&#8217;re sure to factor into race proceedings.

The post PTO Canadian Open: Women’s Race Preview appeared first on PTO .",https://protriathletes.org/news/rss,"<p>The PTO Canadian Open gets underway tomorrow, with one of the strongest fields ever assembled in pro triathlon ready for action in Edmonton.</p>



<p>With 32 of the world’s top-ranked women battling to earn a slice of the $1m prize purse – the winner will earn a cool $100,000 – plus the chance to take a historical first-ever PTO Tour title, there’s a lot on the line this weekend.</p>



<p>Live coverage of the race starts at 10:30am local time (16:30 UTC). If you’re in Europe or the Indian Subcontinent, the race will be broadcast live exclusively on <a href=""https://www.eurosport.co.uk/triathlon/pto-tour/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Eurosport</a>. For the rest of the world, you can watch either via <a href=""https://plus.protriathletes.org/home"">desktop or app on PTO+</a>. Check out our <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/how-to-watch/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">How To Watch page</a> for full listings.</p>



<p>The race course is far from straightforward with laps, hills and sharp turns to contend with. After the three-lap 2km swim in Hawrelak Park Lake, it’s on to an unforgiving four-lap bike course that’ll test athletes’ ability to climb, descend, corner and maintain focus. With few chances to find a rhythm, we could see a different dynamic during the bike leg than is typical on less technical courses. The run is also four laps, the flat, out-and-back course giving chasers plenty of opportunities to judge their gains as they close on the leaders.</p>



<p>The women’s race boasts one of the deepest fields ever assembled. Here’s a run-down of some of the highest-ranked athletes to watch out for.</p>



<p>Topping the list is PTO World #3 <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Laura Philipp</a>. Nothing short of an absolute racing machine, the German star set a new world-best time for the 70.3 distance in March and came achingly close to doing the same at the full distance in Hamburg last month. Forced to sit out the IM world champs due to Covid, Philipp is raring to take a big title and is certainly a race favourite.</p>



<p>Next up is PTO World #7 <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Skye Moench</a> who races for the USA but actually began life in Canada. Though more attuned to the full distance, Moench’s sheer power means she remains a threat in any race.</p>



<p>Britain’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/emma-pallant"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Emma Pallant-Browne</a> (PTO World #8) is one of the best middle-distance athletes the sport has ever seen and has already clocked four wins this season. “It’s an incredible event, an incredible thing to be a part of the first one,” said Pallant-Browne during the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pMgHX5GM4g"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Canadian Open press conference</a>. “To win… I don’t think there are many words to describe it. The quality of the fields here – there’s so many people with so much potential and it’s going to make for a really exciting event.”</p>



<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jeanni-metzler"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jeanni Metzler</a> (PTO World #9) proved herself a stellar racer with a savage run in 2021. The South African is on the comeback trail after striving to overcome mental health issues during the winter but that doesn’t make her any less a danger to the competition.</p>



<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Paula Findlay</a> (PTO World #10) hails from Edmonton – her mother, Sheila is the race director! – so this hometown hero has both the pressure and confidence which comes with that. “I’m trying not to let [the pressure] really get to me and try to use it more as excitement than nerves,” said Findlay at the press conference. “It’s really cool to be back in Edmonton… I know the roads really well and it’s really fun to see my face and Lionel’s face all over the city on the banners… and I’m just trying to use that to get me excited to race.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a really unique course. It’s very technical… it kind-of looks like a World Cup ITU circuit with lots of corners, lots of climbing, lots of descending. So I think it’ll make for an interesting race and no-one knows what to expect so it’s a cool course.” Indeed, Findlay’s background in short-course racing gives her even more of an edge this weekend.</p>



<p>Beyond these top-five-ranked athletes, the depth-in-strength just keeps rolling. There’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/fenella-langridge"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Fenella Langridge</a>, up to PTO World #11 after a stellar second-place performance in Roth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jackie-hering"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jackie Hering</a> (PTO World #12) will be gunning for the top spot but is keenly aware of the quality of field this first PTO Tour event has attracted. “I’m not going to lie, there’s an extremely intimidating list of people at this race,” said Hering. “I just think it’s amazing the amount of Olympians and champions… But it’s important for me to try not to think about that and just focus on my own race and controlling how I execute my race, which I do feel confident in doing, and just not worry about everyone else.”</p>



<p>Other athletes to contend with include <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/holly-lawrence"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Holly Lawrence</a> (PTO World #13); double Olympic medallist <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/nicola-spirig"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Nicola Spirig</a> (PTO World #15) and Australia’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ashleigh-gentle"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ashleigh Gentle</a> (PTO World #17) whose recent move from World Triathlon racing to long course should make her one to watch in Edmonton.</p>



<p>That’s only the top-10 seeded athletes in the race and there are plenty more for whom a podium place wouldn’t be a surprise! <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/race/pto-tour-/2022/participants"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Check out the full women’s start list</a> below to see all the athletes ready to duke it out in Edmonton.</p>

<p>Backing up an incredibly strong women’s start list for the <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/canadian-open/"">PTO Canadian Open</a>, the men’s field by no means disappoints with the upper echelons of the male PTO World Rankings ready to do battle in Edmonton!</p>



<p>On Sunday 24 July it will be the men’s turn to do battle for a share of the $1m prize purse on offer as well as a 10% PTO points bonus on offer – a factor that could prove crucial as the event is also the last qualifying race for this year’s Collins Cup. This year’s Collins Cup qualification could prove even more competitive than last year’s so every point is going to fought for tooth and nail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PTO World #1 <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kristian-blummenfelt"">Kristian Blummenfelt</a> is the highest-ranked athlete set to start and will be joined by his Norwegian counterpart, colleague and competitor <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden"">Gustav Iden</a> (PTO World #2). This will be the first time that the two get to battle it out in a long-distance setting having previously chosen different races to each other or mechanical issues putting a stop to any all-out racing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Norwegian pair will also have the likes of the lion <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders"">Lionel Sanders</a> (PTO World #3) to contend with over the 100km course and he is hungry to take the Norwegians down a peg or two. Then comes a flurry of European stars all of whom will be targeting a spot of Team Europe at The Collins Cup; <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/daniel-baekkegard"">Daniel Bækkegård</a> (PTO World #5), <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/patrick-lange"">Patrick Lange</a> (PTO World #10) <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/magnus-elbaek-ditlev"">Magnus Ditlev</a> (PTO World #11) and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/joe-skipper"">Joe Skipper</a> (PTO World #13).</p>

<p>Also joining the European party in Edmonton is none other than <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sebastian-kienle"">Sebastian Kienle</a> (PTO World #33), in what will be his final year racing as a pro Sebi has chosen the PTO Canadian Open as one of his top priority races to go out with a bang!</p>



<p>Then in the US camp the likes of <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/matt-hanson"">Matt Hanson</a> (PTO World #8) <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-kanute"">Ben Kanute</a> (PTO World #16), <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/rudy-von-berg"">Rudy Von Berg</a> (PTO World #18) and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jason-west"">Jason West</a> (PTO World #24) join the parade of stars and stripes in Edmonton all keen to make an impression on their next-door neighbours!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last and by no means least come the International athletes, including those Canadians who have the home turf advantage! <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry"">Jackson Laundry</a> (PTO World #15) joins Sanders in the lineup of Canadians who get to race at home, cheered on by their home crowds from the grandstands. Other International athletes include <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-appleton"">Sam Appleton</a> (PTO World #22), <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kyle-smith"">Kyle Smith</a> (PTO World #23) and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/matt-trautman"">Matt Trautman</a> (PTO World #32) all of whom will be ready to show their strength on the day as well as to prove themselves worthy of a Collins Cup spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a veritable who’s who from the upper echelons of the PTO World Rankings set to do battle in Edmonton, the first <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/canadian-open/"">PTO Canadian Open</a> – which is also the inaugural PTO Tour event – is set to make history on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Come Saturday 23 July, not only will the women battle it out for a slice of a whopping $1m prize purse but there’s also a 10% PTO points bonus on offer – a factor that could prove crucial as the event is also the last qualifying race for this year’s Collins Cup. With competition for automatic Collins Cup qualification fierce, expect athletes vying for a spot on Team Europe, Team US and Team International to fight for every place right down the field.</p>



<p>So, who are some of the names you can look forward to seeing at the PTO Canadian Open?</p>



<p>PTO World #2 <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Laura Philipp</a> of Germany is the highest-ranked athlete set to start but will face tough competition from the likes of the American duo <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/taylor-knibb"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Taylor Knibb</a> (PTO World #6) and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Skye Moench</a> (PTO World #7), Britain’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/emma-pallant"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Emma Pallant-Browne</a> (PTO World #8), South Aftrica’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jeanni-metzler"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jeanni Metzler</a> (PTO World #9) and Edmonton hometown hero <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Paula Findlay</a> (PTO World #10).</p>



<p>And that’s just the top 10! Other in-form contenders at the 100km distance include the USA’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jackie-hering"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jackie Hering</a> (PTO World #11) Britain’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/holly-lawrence"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Holly Lawrence</a> (PTO World #12), American <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Chelsea Sodaro</a> (PTO World #17) Canada’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/tamara-jewett"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Tamara Jewett</a> (PTO World #18), Spain’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sara-perez-sala"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Sara Perez Sala</a> (PTO World #20) and the Aussie one-two of <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ellie-salthouse"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ellie Salthouse</a> (PTO World #21) and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ashleigh-gentle"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ashleigh Gentle</a> (PTO World #24).</p>



<p>One other name to keep in mind is PTO World #3 <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-haug"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Anne Haug</a>, who’s playing her cards close to her chest ahead of her race at Challenge Roth this weekend. If she does make it to Edmonton, she’s surely one to watch.</p>



<div class=""pto-embed"" data-src=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/race/pto-tour-/2022/participants/FPRO/embed""></div><script async="""" src=""https://platform.protriathletes.org/embed.js""></script>



<p>In terms of the Collins Cup, the PTO Canadian Open could prompt movement in automatic qualifications, especially for Team US and Team International. With Heather Jackson not racing and Chelsea Sodaro and <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jocelyn-mccauley"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Jocelyn McCauley</a> (PTO World #19) just a couple of points behind, one of them could nab that fourth qualifying spot for Team US.</p>



<p>For Team International, Jeanni Metzler just needs a race finish to solidifiy her top-place on the team but slots three and four – currently occupied by Tamara Jewett and Ellite Salthouse – could be threatened by strong races from Brazil’s <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/luisa-baptista"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Luisa Baptista</a> (PTO World #23) and Ashleigh Gentle, who are just two points shy apiece.</p>



<p>For Team Europe, things are a little more set with the top four PTO World Ranked athletes holding the same positions for the Collins Cup. With the 10% bonus on offer in Edmonton, an absolutely stellar performance from Emma Pallant-Browne might just oust Kat Matthews but it’s a big ask!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more on the PTO Canadian Open including the men’s field and wildcard athlete reveals!</p>

<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Women’s Sub8 Contenders</h3>



<p>Like Sub7, the Sub8 teams didn’t have a smooth ride to the start line. 2012 Olympic Champion and 2016 Olympic silver medal winner Nicola Spirig crashed hard in February, coming off her bike to break her collarbone and some ribs as well as puncturing her lung. The gritty Swiss star put all that behind her to take on the challenge of Sub8 in her final professional year.</p>



<p>PTO World #5 and reigning IM 70.3 World Champion&nbsp;<a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lucy-charles-barclay"">Lucy Charles-Barclay</a>&nbsp;was initially slated to face off against Spirig but a stress fracture of the hip meant giving way to fellow Brit, Kat Matthews, in April. Matthews, second at the Ironman World Championship in May and perhaps the long-course world’s preeminent bike-runner has had a rapid rise in the sport, boasting a ferocious 2:49:48 Ironman marathon best.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Sub8 Race</h3>



<p>Both women opted for two swim pacers and after initially leading, Spirig was overhauled by Matthews in the closing stages. By the end, the pair finished the first leg only seven seconds apart after 3.8km in the water, just shy of 55 minutes.</p>



<p>Matthews and her team quickly made time on the bike, but the gap to Spirig didn’t balloon too far, settling in just below four minutes. That buffer eventually came down to around three minutes as Matthews’ pace lowered in the closing stages of the 180km course around the Dekra Lausitzring track.</p>



<p>With a 2:37 marathon PB, that was a deficit many thought Spirig could erase – and initially, that looked to be the case. Slowly reeling in Matthews, Spirig made the catch with around 14km to go but the Brit kept the Swiss superfrau in her sights and kept her cool to repass 3km later and build a convincing lead.</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image alignwide size-large""><img loading=""lazy"" decoding=""async"" width=""1024"" height=""683"" src=""https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sub7Sub8-kat-matthews-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""Kat Matthews at Sub7Sub8"" class=""wp-image-23044"" srcset=""https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sub7Sub8-kat-matthews-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sub7Sub8-kat-matthews-300x200.jpg 300w, https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sub7Sub8-kat-matthews-768x512.jpg 768w, https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sub7Sub8-kat-matthews.jpg 1200w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"" /><figcaption>Photo: James Mitchell</figcaption></figure>



<p>Matthews remained metronomic in her pace, holding strong for a 2:46:09 marathon time and an overall finish of 7:31:54 – within a minute of her goal time. Spirig dug deep to clock a faster marathon time than the Brit – 2:45 – and crossed the line in 7:34:19.</p>



<p>While pre-race pundits postulated that the Sub8 barrier would be the easier to take down – Chrissie Wellington’s iron-distance world-best at Roth standing at 8:18 – the margin by which both women smashed that mark was astonishing and inspiring in equal measure.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Men’s Sub7 Contenders</h3>



<p>When the idea for Sub7Sub8 was announced, there were many raised eyebrows about the inclusion of Blummenfelt, who, at the time, was yet to complete an iron-distance race. A couple of seasons on, the Norwegian took to the start line of Sub7 in Germany as world number one, World Triathlon Champion, Olympic Champion and Ironman World Champion, proving doubters wrong at every turn.</p>



<p>A six-time full-distance champ, Skipper joined Sub7 just eight days from the race start after dual Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee bowed out due to a stress reaction injury. In gamely jumping in, the Brit certainly gained some new fans while cementing his position as the ‘junkyard’ underdog.</p>



<h3 class=""wp-block-heading"">The Sub7 Race</h3>



<p>Each with a single swim pacer in Lars Botellier for Blummenfelt and Alistair Brownlee for Skipper, the Norwegian drew first blood, besting the Brit by five minutes out of the water. Once on the bike though, the power and discipline of the team put together by Brownlee – including former hour-record holder Alex Dowsett – shone through.</p>



<p>Storming past Blummenfelt, Skipper gave the Olympic champ his trademark junkyard dog bark, the team going on to an astonishing 3:16 bike split, some eight minutes quicker than Blummenfelt’s squad and clocking over 55kmph average. There was also a hairy moment for the world number one along the way when a touch of wheels in the group nearly sent them down like a pack of dominoes.</p>



<p>On the marathon, Skipper put in an exceptional effort but even a stunning 2:36 run wasn’t enough to hold off the Norwegian’s advance. Woofing back at Skipper as he passed around 17km in, Blummenfelt steamrollered to victory with a 2:30 marathon, crossing the line in 6:44:25 while Skipper came home in 6:47:36 – both comfortably under the seven-hour mark.</p>



<p id=""blummenfelt-video"">While Sub7Sub8 might not result in any new official records, it was certainly one of the most compelling and entertaining triathlon events of recent years. Let’s hope we get to see more athletes take on similar challenges in the future to push the barriers of human performance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we know what Blummenfelt is up to next as the Norwegian powerhouse confirmed his intention to race at the <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/canadian-open/"">PTO Canadian Open</a> on 24 July. There’s just a month to go to <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/canadian-open/"">enter the event yourself</a> – so you can race an iconic course, then hit the grandstand to see Blummenfelt do his thing!</p>



<h2 class=""wp-block-heading"">Laura Philipp Makes A Statement In Hamburg</h2>



<p>Going into last weekend, we thought all the references to Chrissie Wellington’s world-best iron-distance time of 8:18:13 would be reserved for Sub8 but while Matthews and Spirig were being paced around a race track, PTO World #3&nbsp;<a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp"">Laura Philipp</a>&nbsp;was putting together a devastating performance at IM Hamburg.</p>



<p>A quick check on&nbsp;<a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/race/im-hamburg/2021/results"">previous years’ results at IM Hamburg</a>&nbsp;showed a women’s course record of 8:54:30 – set in 2021 by Laura Zimmermann – where the AIT (Adjusted Ideal Time) was 8:43:19. With that in mind, it seemed unlikely that we’d see super-fast times despite Philipp’s pedigree and the event’s European Championship status. How wrong we were!</p>



<p>Finding the feet of iron-rookie&nbsp;<a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro"">Chelsea Sodaro</a>&nbsp;(now moved up 13 places to PTO World #17), Philipp and the American left the water together just ahead of France’s&nbsp;<a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/manon-genet"">Manon Genet</a>&nbsp;(PTO World #32). Once on the bike, Philipp pushed hard to gap Sodaro – and had to, as the US star chased hard over her maiden 180km and would only lose four minutes by T2. Philipp posted a staggering bike split of 4:31:14, one of the fastest ever seen in the sport.</p>

<p>Leaving transition, Philipp showed zero after-effects of the tough Covid bout that kept her from the IM world champs in St. George. Simply sensational throughout the run, German bounded around the course to a mind-blowing 2:45:38 marathon for an 8:18:20 finish. That’s just seven seconds shy of Chrissie Wellington’s world best time with a run split that bettered Kat Matthews’ Sub8 attempt.</p>



<p>Sodaro came home with an impressive first iron-distance time of 8:36 while Genet rounded out the podium in 8:52.</p>



<p>The result is a huge score of 115.08 PTO World Rankings Points for Philipp, which, with the addition of a 10% bonus for her single best iron-distance performance of the year, put her score at 126.59 meaning she jumped two places in the rankings up to PTO World #2.</p>



<p>This sets the stage for the rest of the season with Philipp yet to face PTO World #1 and recently crowned Ironman World Champion, <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-ryf"">Daniela Ryf</a> – a matchup we could see at the <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/canadian-open/"">PTO Canadian Open</a> in July before the pair are likely to join forces for Team Europe at the <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/collins-cup/"">Collins Cup</a> in August!</p>

<p class=""p1"">The inaugural PTO Pro Am showcased the sizzling speed and spectacular strength of PTO professionals, Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF) athletes and amateur special guests with Team Sanders coming out on top ahead of Team Baekkegard and Team Long. There were plenty of spine-tingling moments as the athletes moved through swim, bike and run from Venice Beach to Downtown.</p>

<h3 class=""p1"">How The PTO Pro Am Played Out</h3>
<p class=""p1"">The swim was dominated by three-time Paralympian Chris Hammer (Team Jackson) and 2019 World Para Swimming Championships silver medallist Ahalya Lettenberger (Team Chura), the two trading the lead over the 1500m swim. It was Hammer who made the tag first, passing to Heather Jackson with Haley Chura leaving T1 close behind. Haven Shepherd put in a fantastic swim to minimise the deficit, giving Lionel Sanders just a couple of minutes to make up to the women. Emily Gray was next back to the beach, giving Sam Long a shot to chase down his rival. Next, Allysa Seely passed the baton to Daniel Baekkegard before Jamal Hill tagged in Skye Moench.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Jackson hung tough at the front but the catch from Sanders, reigning Canadian Hour Record holder, was an inevitability. There wasn’t even a glance to his competitor as Sanders passed, full of determination. Ripping through the 40km bike course, the reigning Canadian Hour Record holder had extended his lead by the time he reached Downtown LA and T2.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">With Sanders tagging former UFC star Paul Felder into the action at the front of the race, Daniel Baekkegard caught Sam Long just before transition, meaning Modern Pentathlon Olympic silver medallist Heather Fell (Team Baekkegard) and five-time Paralympic medallist Rudy Garcia-Tolson (Team Long) started the run just steps apart. Further back, Team Jackson was out of the race after Heather Jackson suffered a blown tyre on the bike.</p>
<p class=""p1"">At the front, Felder was gunning for a new 10km PB, storming up the hills and pushing right to the line to ensure Team Sanders’ victory and the first-ever PTO Pro Am title. Despite a wrong turn between run laps, Heather Fell showed fantastic form – no-doubt honed by a never-ending stream of GTN challenges – to secure silver for Team Baekkegard. Rudy Garcia-Tolson, classy as ever, completed the podium for Team Long. That put Team Chura in fourth after an anchor leg from Roderick Sewell and Team Moench in fifth, Dr Kent Bradley taking it to the line.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Winner’s Quotes</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Interviewed by <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/news/pto-pro-am-los-angeles-how-to-watch-live/"">new PTO presenter Rachel Stringer</a>, Team Sanders were clearly buzzed by the event and their victory.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“I knew they had assembled a strong team because we were going to dominate this event from start to finish,” said Sanders. “Haven got us a big lead and then I just tried to hang on to it and then Paul brought it home so it was a lot of fun… It was a full-blown competition. I knew I’d be out here trying to compare my bike time to the pros and to Sam Long and to Daniel [Baekkegard] so I rode as hard as I can and I’m excited to go look at the results and see where I stacked in the bike portion of the race.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“I would definitely say this is the greatest way to go into your late teens,” said Shepherd “I’d just turned 18 years old going into my Olympic Games and then being asked to do this triathlon with these guys… I was very thankful that they chose me to be on their team… I wanted to go out really nice and smooth but I definitely booked it on the way back to shore!”</p>
<p class=""p1"">“I didn’t do any course preview… the hills were for real out there. When you were going up that thing it was steep so I knew – OK, I could get sub-40… I ran hard and I got to run out there with all the pros and I had such a good start with these guys kicking it off for me so it was awesome.”</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Elite Race Results</h3>
<p class=""p1"">With $100,000 of PTO prize money up for grabs in the elite race, a fast swim and a strong bike legs from the USA’s Eric Lagerstrom and South Africa’s Jamie Riddle put these two at the front of the race by T2 with just over a minute’s lead to Australia’s Steve McKenna. Pushing the pace towards the finish, it was Riddle who kicked ahead to score the victory with Lagerstrom second and McKenna third.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the women’s race, Brazil’s Vittoria Lopes was first out the water, first off the bike and first across the line to claim the win. New Zealand’s Amelia Watkinson was next off the bike ahead of the USA’s Amy Sloan in third, positions that reversed to put the American in second and the Kiwi third by the finish.</p>

<h3>Daniela Ryf – Back To Her Best</h3>
<p>Unwell at Kona in 2019 and having struggled with immune system issues through lockdown, Daniela Ryf put together as perfect a long course performance as we&#8217;ve ever seen to score a whopping 124.6 points. Triathlon fandom was united in awe as the Angry Bird returned to her best with a goosebumps-raising exhibition of dominance.</p>
<p>Fourth out the water, Ryf was soon in the lead on the bike and stuck to the gameplan that had seen her take four IM world titles going into St. George – ride hard and then, when everyone else&#8217;s legs are burning, ride even harder. Leading by seven minutes at the start of the run, a sub-three-hour marathon created an almost nine-minute margin of victory to second place <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/katrina-matthews"">Kat Matthews</a> and 12 minutes to defending world champ, <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-haug"">Anne Haug</a>.</p>

<p>With an Adjusted Ideal Time (AIT) of 08:54:42, Ryf&#8217;s 8:34:58 finish was certainly worthy of her colossal points score, which saw her regain the lead in the PTO World Rankings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kat Matthews&#8217; second place saw her score 113.59 points to move up three places into PTO World #3. Anne Haug also moved up three spots, her 109.56 score seeing her move up into PTO World #2 just above Matthews.</p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench"">Skye Moench</a> (fourth in St. George) moved up one place to PTO World #7 while <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lisa-norden"">Lisa Norden</a> jumped five spots to PTO World #12. <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ruth-astle"">Ruth Astle</a> was the biggest mover, moving up 16 places to PTO World #15. Fellow Brit <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/fenella-langridge"">Fenella Langridge</a> improved by three places to take the PTO World #19 slot.</p>
<p>Of interest for the Collins Cup, the top five women in the world are all from Team Europe, putting the defending champions in the driving seat for Samorin in August.</p>
<h4>Kristian Blummenfelt – GOAT In The Making?</h4>
<p>With his win in St. George, Kristian Blummenfelt becomes the first reigning Olympic Champion to win an Ironman world title. The win came courtesy of a dominating run performance, the Norwegian clocking 2:38 on a challenging course in tough conditions.</p>

<p>Running at a fearsome pace, Blummenfelt took first around 28km into the marathon and victory looked assured from there. His finish of 7:49:15 – compared to that AIT of 08:00:02 – was worth 114.98 points. With that, Blummenfelt had a third high-scoring race to his name, seeing him rocket 41 places up the rankings, overtaking countryman Gustav Iden to take the coveted PTO World #1 spot.</p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/braden-currie"">Braden Currie</a>, third on the day in St. George, moved up 10 places to become PTO World #6 as well as take the second spot for Team International men in the Collins Cup standings.</p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/florian-angert"">Florian Angert</a> improved by four places to sit one place behind Currie as PTO World #7 while <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/leon-chevalier"">Leon Chevalier</a>&#8216;s breakthrough performance saw him move 16 places to PTO World #11. <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/chris-leiferman"">Chris Leiferman</a> jumped 25 spots to PTO World #13 and become second in the Team US standings for the Collins Cup. <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-laidlow"">Sam Laidlow</a> improved his ranking by 17 places and is now PTO World #16 with <a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-hoffman"">Ben Hoffman</a> climbing six places to PTO World #18 – now fifth in the Team US rankings, just one spot from automatic qualification.</p>
<p>With lots more racing to come this season, there is still plenty of time for the rankings to move around, for athletes to secure Collins Cup qualification and to earn a bigger slice of the PTO&#8217;s $2,008,000 end-of-year bonus pool!</p>

Learn about the contenders in our race preview.</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The stage is set for the ‘Battle of Champions’ at the Ironman World Championships in St. George, Utah. This is the first time that the race will be held outside the island of Hawaii and provides a brand new and challenging course for the athletes to contend with.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The strength of both the men’s and women’s fields is seriously impressive with Olympic champions, multiple Kona winners, young blood and experienced veterans creating a plethora of athletes who could contend for the win or reach the podium.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">However, the lack of athletes including </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-frodeno""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jan Frodeno</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/patrick-lange""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Patrick Lange</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/joe-skipper""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joe Skipper</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Laura Philipp</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lucy-charles-barclay""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lucy Charles-Barclay</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> – unable to race due to injury or illness – will no doubt shake up the race dynamics as triathlon looks to crown its first IM world champ since October 2019.</span></p>
<h2><b>Men’s Race</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>The Norwegian Hype</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since transitioning to long course racing, superstars </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gustav Iden</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #1) and </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kristian-blummenfelt""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kristian Blummenfelt</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #42) have left a clear mark on the sport, with many suggesting they are now the ones to beat. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This will be Blummenfelt’s second ever full distance race, having previously only raced IM Cozumel where he set the world-best time over the distance. Iden has also only ever raced one full-distance race previously, IM Florida. Astonishing performances from both Norwegians in their first full-distance efforts made the triathlon world sit up and pay attention.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Norwegian pair will both likely come out of the water either at the back of the first swim pack or the front of the second and try to bridge up to the lead bikers early on. Even if either of them is 5-10 minutes back coming off the bike, their run prowess – having clocked 2:35 marathons on debut – will mean they are very much still in for a chance of the win. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>The Great Dane</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With a podium finish at the 70.3 World Championships last year and a proven track record over the full distance, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/daniel-baekkegard""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daniel Bækkegård</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #4) is undoubtedly a strong podium contender. As a strong swimmer, Bækkegård will be able to stick with the front swim pack and set himself up to be in the mix at the front of the race. </span></p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom:30px } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class=""embed-container""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJvbYKm6l_k&amp;t=719s"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The only possible question mark over Bækkegård in regards to his chances of winning is his run. Bækkegård’s best marathon to date is 2:45 (by no means slow), however, with the likes of Blummenflet, Iden as well as </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-van-berkel""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jan Van Berkel</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> all having clocked sub 2:40 marathons, the Dane would likely require a significant gap going into the run to hold them all off. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Alistair Brownlee</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At 70.3 Oceanside a little over a month ago, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/alistair-brownlee""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alistair Brownlee</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> proved that his longstanding injuries have been put to bed. Brownlee was expected by to wipe the floor with the competition in California but that certainly did not end up being the case. After leading for most of the run, Brownlee came home in a disappointing fourth behind a sensational </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jackson Laundry</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and that epic sprint finish between </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/rudy-von-berg""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rudy Von Berg</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and Lionel Sanders. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brownlee put it down to not being over a recent illness, so we can only hope that he has been able to recover fully so we can see him at his double-Olympic winning best. The Brit’s overall swim, bike and run prowess mean that if he is showing up healthy and measures his efforts accordingly he can absolutely be counted as a contender for the win. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>No Limits Lionel, Yo Yo Yo Sam Long and Catch me if you Cam Wurf</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> </span></h3>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lionel Sanders</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #3), </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-long""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sam Long</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #5) and </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/cameron-wurf""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cam Wurf</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #31) are three athletes who are sure to provide excitement no matter the final race outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In classic Cam Wurf fashion, it was still unclear until </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPp_bPs-ELE""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">yesterday’s appearance on Breakfast with Bob</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> if he would be racing due to commitments to pro cycling team Ineos Grenadiers. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We can all say that we are thrilled to see Cam being able to make the race, including Sanders and Long who have both said how happy they are to have Wurf’s firepower on the bike. Wurf was always known to be one of the best cyclists in triathlon but over the past two years he has proven these credentials in pro cycling. Only last week Wurf could be seen leading out over the famous cobbles of Paris Roubaix, setting up an incredible win for his team. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sanders, Long and Wurf have all historically had similar swim abilities and have needed their strong bikes to allow them to bridge the gap to the lead group. This will be the case once more, though it will be fascinating to see what gains both Sanders and Long have been able to make in the swim having both focused heavily on improving this discipline.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For Sanders and Long it is about being amongst the lead group coming off the bike if they are to have hopes of winning. Though it is possible to make up some deficit on the run to some athletes, it would be a serious challenge to make inroads to the Norwegian duo with even a small deficit.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On paper, Sanders is the better runner and also has form in St. George having won the 70.3 there in May last year by outsprinting Long. On the other hand, Long took second at the 70.3 world – also in St. George – last September.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Sebi’s Looking To Surprise Himself</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another athlete who could be in the mix with the chasing bike pack, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/sebastian-kienle""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sebastian Kienle</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #36) is the only previous IM World Champion on the men’s side who has made it to the start line (with Lange and Frodeno both injured). Kienle announced he will retire at the end of 2023, making this his penultimate chance to bag another IM world title.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Though Kienle is in the latter stages of his career, this absolutely does not rule him out of podium contention. For Kienle, it will be important to minimise his deficit on the swim and then get to work on the bike, likely being surrounded by fellow uber bikers Sanders, Long and Wurf. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kienle has struggled with injury on and off for the last couple of years so we can only hope that he is fully healthy coming into this race and if he is able to come off the bike with or near the front of the race, there is absolutely no reason to rule him out of winning it all!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Other Contenders  </b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Already mentioned for his run abilities, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-van-berkel""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jan Van Berkel</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #30) could very well be one of those athletes we see working their way through the field late in the race and could very well have podium chances depending on what is happening around him. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The USA’s </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-hoffman""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ben Hoffman</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #24) has form at IM World Championships having clocked four top-10 finishes including second back in 2014. Hoffmann is also coming off a fantastic win at IM Texas two weeks ago, a performance that saw him rise a whipping 57 places in the PTO World Rankings.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/braden-currie""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Braden Currie</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #16), one of those athletes who loves the big stages and has previously been able to achieve fifth place finish in the world champs. Perhaps he will be able to improve on it this Saturday. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then there is </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/kyle-smith""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kyle Smith</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #22), actually picked as one of Jan Frodeno’s favourites to be on the podium once everything has been left out on the course. Smith and Frodeno are training partners so if anyone has the inside track on the form that Smith is bringing into the race, it’d be the German star.</span></p>

<h2><b>Women’s Race</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Daniela Ryf – Queen of St. George?</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With four Ironman world titles </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-ryf""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daniela Ryf</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #3) is known by many as the Queen of Kona, but will she also be crowned monarch of St. George this weekend? Ryf has won four IM World Championships, five 70.3 world titles and has dominated the sport for years. However, in recent months Ryf has had some disappointing performances (some would say out of character) where she would have typically been expected to dominate.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is no doubt that if Ryf is firing on all cylinders then she is undoubtedly one of the favourites to take the win. Her game plan is sure to be the same as in her other victories – </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">catching the leaders on the bike and then riding away from them to establish a large enough gap to hold off faster runners. If the likes of Haug, Matthews or anyone who can put in a strong run are level with Ryf at the start of the run then Ryf’s chances of victory will be significantly lowered. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Haug’s Title Defence</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After two years since the last IM World Championship, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-haug""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Anne Haug</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #5) is finally able to defend her title. The German has banked strong and consistent results over the last year despite battling with Covid-induced diabetes during 2021. Unlike many of her fellow athletes, she managed to stay injury-free, however.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In her most recent race at IM 70.3 Lanzarote in March, Haug finished second, four minutes behind Kat Matthews. Likely not the result that she would have wanted in her main build race going into St. George against one of her main competitors. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Haug did say in her Breakfast with Bob interview this week that she had experimented with coming straight from an altitude camp to the Lanzarote race and could still feel the effects of altitude and the sluggishness in her system. Haug took this as a learning and adjusted the timing of her altitude camp leading into St. George – hopefully to good effect. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If Haug is to take the title, she will need to ride smart and run at her best. Making up a deficit on the run to most athletes is well within Haug’s ability but if the German gives away too much time to Matthews on the bike, closing on the fleet-footed Brit will be a big ask.</span></p>

<h3><b>Kat Matthews’ Debut Champs</b></h3>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/katrina-matthews""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kat Matthews</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #6) has taken the triathlon world rather by storm since turning pro in 2019, impressing with podiums and wins including IM Florida in 2020 and IM UK in 2021 before winning 70.3 Lanzarote in March. Though Matthews has form across all three disciplines, it is her bike-run combination that is her true weapon. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This will be the first IM World Championships for Matthews and she has lofty ambitions of wanting to take the win. This is not at all outlandish though, looking at her track record Matthews has the goods to back this up. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matthews can be expected to exit the water amongst the second pack of swimmers and will want to bridge to the front (and potentially ride away) as quickly as possible. To give Matthews the best chance of victory over Haug, she will be looking for a buffer after the bike given the two being closely matched on the run. With that talent for running, Matthews can be confident that if she comes off the bike with anyone other than Haug, she could comfortably see them off. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>US Hopefuls </b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At the top of the list of strong female contenders who are racing on home soil are </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skye Moench</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/jocelyn-mccauley""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jocelyn McCauley</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/heather-jackson""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heather Jackson</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As the top-ranked US athlete on the start line, Skye Moench (PTO World #8) goes into St. George as the favourite among the Americans. This long-distance specialist had a strong and consistent 2021 and came fifth and sixth at 70.3 St. George and the IM 70.3 worlds in St. George respectively last year. That being said in Moench’s final IM of 2021 – Florida – it was Heather Jackson who beat her to the top step. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin-bottom:30px } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class=""embed-container""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUWVGbpN4wg?t=138"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In an interview with Triathlon Mockery, Moench said Heather Jackson is one athlete she would like to bark at like a junkyard dog as she passes, so perhaps we’ll see these two fighting it out throughout the race for the top US-finisher accolade.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most recent victory for Heather Jackson (PTO World #13) was that race against Moench at IM Florida at the end of 2021. Having had a difficult season until that point, the result was surely a confidence boost showing training was working – boding well for this race. However, Jackson’s only race to date this year yielded her a DNF at Oceanside. That said, Jackson often rises to the occasion – as shown by her four top-five performances in Kona.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class=""embed-container""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwESiuBXzTc"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Like Ben Hoffman, Jocelyn McCauley (PTO World #15) is coming into St. George having raced and won IM Texas two weeks ago. This certainly shows that McCauley is in great form but the question is whether she’s been able to recover from this effort. Racing a full distance race within two to three weeks of the World Championships is a risky tactic but could it pay dividends for an iron-distance specialist like McCauley?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>Other Contenders</b></h3>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/lisa-norden""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lisa</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nordén</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #17) hasn’t quite fullfilled the promise of her Olympic-silver winning performance since stepping up to long course, but there’s no doubt she’s one of the strongest cyclists in the sport. A good swimmer, too, Norden could push the pace alongside Ryf on the bike to try and hold off swifter runners.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/fenella-langridge""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fenella Langridge</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #22) impressed on her IM debut last year, coming second at Coeur d’Alene and third in Roth. Her first world champs, this great swimmer might just share the limelight with Haley Chura at the front of the race. She’s got the bike chops too so could feature well towards the finish line.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/ruth-astle""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ruth Astle</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #31) took two Ironman titles late last year, clinching victories in Mallorca and South Africa. Her strong bike legs could play a role in St. George leading a chasing pack to cut swim deficits but she’ll need a much improved run to factor in the overall – the question is whether the Brit has made those gains over winter.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/joanna-ryter""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joanna Ryter</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO World #43) might not be the biggest Swiss name in the women’s field, but she’s one to watch. After four top-five Ironman finishes last season, Ryter came third in Texas a fortnight ago. Her 94% run ranking tells you all you need to know – look out for her making up places on the marathon.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At PTO World #73, </span><a href=""https://stats.protriathletes.org/athlete/maja-stage-nielsen""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Maja Stage Nielsen</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s palmares don’t match the cream of the crop in St. George, but solid performances in Kona – 12th, 15th and 11th over the last three editions – along with podiums in Lanzarote and Cozumel show she can handle the heat. This was proved recently at Clash Miami, where the Dane took third place. If attrition in St. George is anything like that race, Stage Nielsen could be the one to profit.</span></p>

Here&#8217;s what you can look forward to!</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here at PTO HQ, we’re getting seriously excited about our latest announcement – the full line-up of events at this year’s <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/collins-cup/"">Collins Cup</a> – and how this five-day smorgasbord of multisport goodness will be the ultimate triathlon festival.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Running from 18 to 21 August and held at the <a href=""https://www.x-bionicsphere.com/en/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">x-bionic sphere</a> near Bratislava in Slovakia, the centrepiece of the festival is the second edition of the game-changing Collins Cup. This race for triathlon glory will see Team Europe trying to defend their title against Team USA and Team International. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Attend the festival and you’ll get to sit in the grandstand to watch the action unfold live alongside three massive screens showing the live broadcast. 12 of the world’s best pro triathletes per team, backed by tri legend team captains, will make up 12 hotly fought one-vs-one-vs-one match races. To the winners, the Collins Cup trophy and the next chapter in Collins Cup history. To the losers, the Broken Spokes trophy – a year-long motivator to fight back harder next year.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But outside of this Superbowl of triathlon for the professionals, there’s a whole host of other races and activities to satisfy your appetite for triathlon racing and fandom. <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/PTOEventWelcomeGuide2022.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Check out our welcome guide with an intro from Alistair Brownlee</a> and read on to learn more.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collins Cup Age-Group Race</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First up, there’s the Collins Cup age group race: held over 100km, it’ll challenge you to redefine your limits of speed and endurance. Hold strong form over the 2km swim, eke out bigger watts during 80km bike then straddle that redline to beast the 18km run. You can also race as a relay if you want to focus on one or two of the disciplines along with friends or family.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We’ve made the entry fees as affordable as possible with no additional Active fees while our <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/collins-cup/#qodef-tab-c93fcd4"">industry-leading refund policy</a> is in place to allay fears of possible cancellation or potential non-attendance due to covid, injury or even pregnancy. <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/events/pto-tour/collins-cup/"">Learn more and enter on our Collins Cup race page</a>.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">World Triathlon &amp; Aquathlon Championships</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re in the hunt to don your national colours, the Collins Cup is also the place to race… and not just in triathlon either. Working in partnership with <a href=""https://triathlon.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">World Triathlon</a>, the sport’s global governing body, the Collins Cup will host the 2022 World Triathlon Long Distance World Championship. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Held over the same distance at the open Collins Cup age-group race, this event will give you the chance to earn an age-group world championship title alongside the elite, under-23 and junior divisions. There’s also the World Triathlon Aquabike Championship (2km swim, 80km bike) and the World Triathlon Aquathlon Championship – an opportunity for swim-run specialists to strut their skillset over a 1km swim, 5km run format.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Entry to these World Triathlon events is via your national triathlon governing body only, so if you’re interested in racing get in touch with them directly to state your interest, check qualification criteria and see if you’re eligible.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’re coming to watch the pro race rather than take on 100km yourself, but feel inspired to get your heart beating, there will also be a Fun Run. This relaxed 5km dash will help you get into the spirit of competition – and burn the calories required to take full advantage of all the delicious food on offer.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Collins Cup Opening Ceremony is an opportunity to get up close to the pros in their team attire and feel the electricity as the 12 race match-ups are announced.

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meanwhile, the PTO Tour Fan Zone is sure to tempt you with the latest gear, nutrition and tech from the world of triathlon. There will be plenty for both athletes and supporters including a Kids’ Zone, food trucks offering a variety of deliciousness and other surprises you’ll have to wait to see.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On Saturday night, we’ll have a special Champions Concert from Emma Drobna, Slovakia’s leading pop star, to celebrate the Collins Cup victors in style.

<p>From short to long-course, there are few accolades that Spirig does not have to her name. Olympic gold from the 2012 London Olympic Games – where she beat <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lisa-norden"">Lisa Nordén</a> in a historic sprint finish – is one of those absolutely stand out achievements.</p>
<p>Spirig also secured Olympic silver at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games in a throwdown run battle with Gwen Jorgensen. That was on her way to another Olympic appearance in Toyko, giving her an astonishing record of representing Switzerland at the Olympic Games an incredible five times over the course of 17 years!</p>

<p>Since transitioning to long-course racing Spirig has been equally as impressive, using her dominating bike and run to great effect. In the 11 long-course races she has taken part in, Spirig has finished on the podium every single time. Whatsmore, in 2021 Spirig won every long course race she lined up for.</p>
<p>This leads us to 2022, which is to be Spirig’s final year racing as a professional and has saved perhaps the biggest challenge for last! Spirig is one of the two female athletes who will be taking on the Pho3nix Sub 7/8 Project where athletes will attempt to break eight hours for the women and seven hours for the men over the full (ironman) distance. Athletes will have tools at their disposal not typically allowed in competition, with the event set to be an ‘Ineos 1:59’ style show of human endeavour.</p>

<div class=""embed-container""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrTRveULoJE"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></div>
<p>Spirig is confident that she will be able to break the ambitious target despite a recent injury setback. We join tri fans around the world in feverish anticipation and cannot wait to see her exhibit her triathlon prowess on this incredible stage before signing off on her professional career, which will come to a close with some events in a ‘farewell tour’ of sorts.</p>
<p>Finally, it cannot be overlooked that Spirig has achieved these great heights in triathlon alongside becoming a mother to three children. All mothers will know the momentous challenge of returning to fitness following pregnancy, indeed it’s a situation that would end careers in many professional sports. But each time, Spirig has come back to triathlon at the top of her game and inspired triathlete mothers everywhere to do the same.</p>
<p>This, along with her many years of promoting children’s physical activity, only highlights to an even greater degree the scale of her achievements and the legacy of her epic career.</p>
<p>That just leaves us to say congratulations on an incredible career Nicola! Good luck for your ambitious goals for the year ahead – and enjoy your retirement!</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It wasn’t long until Laundry made his way back to Von Berg, swiftly dispatching him to move into second. Laundry did not stop there though… It wasn’t long before Brownlee was in the Canadian’s sights with the gap growing smaller and smaller until it had disappeared altogether. Brownlee turned to Laundry as the two came level and was clearly less than pleased by Laundry’s presence. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meanwhile, </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/lionel-sanders""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lionel Sanders</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, who left T2 approximately two minutes behind the leaders, had been hunting, running at 1:08 half marathon pace! In the closing kilometres of the run it became clear that Sanders had a good chance of catching third-place Von Berg and perhaps even an outside chance of claiming second ahead of Brownlee. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then everything boiled over! Within the final 500m, Von Berg passed a significantly slowing Brownlee, Sanders doing the same moments later before powering up to Von Berg’s shoulder. It was on! An all out sprint finish for second place saw both athletes refusing to give an inch and in the end, that’s what it came down to – a dead heat that could only be decided by photo finish. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The sprint pace spiked at an eye watering 2:12 min/km as these monster athletes barrelled towards the line! Perhaps a repeat performance will be on the cards this August if both Sanders and Von Berg are pitted against one another at the Collins Cup.</span></p>

<p>Baptista <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CcDAlhtI5es/?utm_medium=copy_link"" rel=""noopener"">recapped her Oceanside race for us on Instagram</a> which you can watch above. Brazilian Baptista found real benefit from the beach start given her swimming prowess and once it came to the bike she thought she’d roll the dice and try something different to maximise her podium chances.</p>
<p>This awesome performance will see the Brazilian take another jump up the rankings and also put her in the ballpark for Team International Collins Cup selection.</p>

The California-based Brit was fourth over the swim and bike legs then rounded out the podium fighting through painful blisters on the run, having opted not to wear socks to save her valuable time in transition. </span></p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ironman South Africa</span></h2>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">South African Men Sweep The Podium</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first full distance race of the season certainly did not disappoint with the racing action that unfolded. A swim shortened to 700m due to rough sea conditions saw the men and women through T1 and onto their bikes in well under 15 minutes. The challenges of the cold, wind and rain more than made up for the shortened swim. Making the podium would be down to not just which athletes boasted the strongest muscular endurance but those who could deal best with the conditions.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/joe-skipper""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joe Skipper</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the men’s favourite going into the race, experienced a small mechanical issue during the bike leg that cost him some time. However, Skipper overcame this setback to ride the fastest bike split of the day and start the run in the leading group. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skipper was not able to maintain the pace of the South African trio of </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/kyle-buckingham""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kyle Buckingham</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/bradley-weiss""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bradley Weiss</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/matt-trautman""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matt Trautman</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and dropped back to fourth. But was it over exertion after his mechanical on the bike or thoughts of saving himself for St George World Championships in a month’s time that saw him post ‘only’ a 2:45 marathon?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">South Africa didn’t provide quite the same explosive finish as the Sanders/Von Berg sprint-off in Oceanside the day before but winner Kyle Buckingham and second place Bradley Weiss were separated by only 19 seconds. Weiss had geen gaining on Buckingham in the final kilometres and had his countryman in sight but Buckingham was able to force every remaining ounce of remaining speed from his body to take his first win since 2018. Keep this form up and Buckingham and Trautman could threaten to break into Team International. </span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bleymehl is Back</span></h3>
<p><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/daniela-bleymehl""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daniela Bleymehl</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">’s return to racing started with a disappointing DNF in Dubai, however, South Africa changed the tide for the German who did not race throughout 2020 and 2021 while she was on maternity leave.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Out of the swim in third and having rode away with a bike split nine minutes faster than the competition, Bleymehl’s closest competitors as the women started the run were World Triathlon Long Distance World Champion </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/sarissa-de-vries""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sarissa De Vries</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/susie-cheetham""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Susie Cheetham</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. After strong starts in the marathon both De Vries and Cheetham unfortunately faded and eventually retired while Bleymehl stayed strong to take victory.</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/elena-illeditsch""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Elena Illeditsch</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> finished second, 10 minutes behind the winner, to make it a German one-two followed by South African </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/magda-nieuwoudt""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Magda Nieuwoudt</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in third, making it a powerful day for South Africans at their home race across the board – and a signal of the nation’s strength for Team International’s captains to take notice of for the Collins Cup.</span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenge Salou</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenge Salou’s swim, like South Africa, could not go ahead as planned but in this case the entire first leg of this Spanish event had to be cancelled for safety reasons. That left a 4km run, 90km bike and 21.1km run to contest in duathlon format.</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Langridge Bags Early Season Win</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the women’s race after the fast and furious run in place of the swim, the trio of </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/lisa-norden""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lisa Nordén</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/fenella-langridge""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fenella Langridge</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/els-visser""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Els Visser</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> established themselves as the front runners on the bike. Some narrow technical sections on the bike course had the three vying for position to avoid the surging that comes after bunching up around the tight turns. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once onto the run, Langridge put time into both Nordén and Visser, with Nordén falling significantly behind to eventually finish in fifth place. Langridge stayed strong throughout to take the win with Visser finishing second and </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/india-lee""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">India Lee</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> rounding out the podium having run the fastest half marathon split of the day. </span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hogenhaug Runs To Victory</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the men’s race it was an equally, if not more, chaotic start with 57 male athletes jostling for the lead over the 4km run. With little to split them by T1, things were just as frenetic on the bike with everyone aiming for the front and no-one wanting to be caught out, meaning lots of surges putting athletes under pressure. </span></p>
<p><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/kristian-hogenhaug""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kristian Hogenhaug</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> showed strong form, clocking the second fastest bike split – </span><a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/athlete/robert-kallin""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Robert Kallin</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> outdid him by just 13 seconds.

<h3>Men’s Race – Brownlee Is Back!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Top Ranked athletes:</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oceanside has seen many epic battles over the years – including an awesome showdown between Lionel Sanders and </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-frodeno""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jan Frodeno</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in 2018 – but one athlete who’s never raced in this stacked-field season opener is double Olympic champ, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/alistair-brownlee""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alistair Brownlee</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">That’s set to change on Saturday though. After his absence in the second half of 2021 following his attempts to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and a long recovery from ankle surgery, two-time Olympic Champion Ali Brownlee is back!</span></p>

<p><script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brownlee will face none other than Lionel Sanders, whose race against Frodeno here in 2018 lit a fire within Sanders that still burns strong to this day. Sanders comes into the 2022 season confident having executed strong consistent performance at the end of 2021 under the guidance of new coach Mikal Iden (big brother and coach of Gustav Iden). </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brownlee and Sanders have met before on three occasions (</span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/race/challenge-samorin/2017/results""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenge Samorin 2017</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/race/im-hawaii/2019/results""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kona 2019</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and the </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/race/challenge-daytona/2020/results""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">PTO 2020 Championship</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) but on all occasions either one or both did not have strong days so have never had the chance to go toe-to-toe with one another. </span></p>
<div class=""h2h"" style=""font-size: 20px; text-align: center; border: 2px solid #d10b0c; font-weight: 600; padding: 5px 10px; display: block; width: fit-content; margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: Avenir Next LT W04 Heavy Cn It,sans-serif; text-transform: uppercase;""><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/head-to-head/alistair-brownlee/lionel-sanders?_ga=2.204361360.1600647043.1648654116-161686127.1646063246"" class=""h2hlink""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Head-to-head: Sanders vs Brownlee</span></a></div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having not seen Brownlee race since his Olympic qualification bid ended in a controversial DQ at WTCS Leeds back in June 2021, it could be reasonable to have a question mark hanging over Brownlee’s form upon return… However, word on the street is that Brownlee is stronger and faster than ever over the middle and long distance!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This would bode well for him in a year where he is also set to go up against Kristian Blummenfelt in the Pho3nix Sub7 Project. While both are aiming to beat the seven-hour mark, they are equally going to be battling to see who can go under seven hours by the biggest margin.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Brownlee and Sanders may be the headline names racing in Oceanside but you should never count out the likes of Ben Kanute, Rudy Von Berg, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jackson Laundry</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-appleton""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sam Appleton</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/matt-hanson""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matt Hanson</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and so many more world class athletes all on the start list. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ben Kanute of course has won Oceanside on the previous two runnings of the race in 2021 and 2019 (the 2020 edition was cancelled due to COVID), beating Rudy Von Berg on one of those occasions in 2019 by just 12 seconds! There will certainly be a score to settle there.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The last (and so far only) time that Daniela Ryf and Taylor Knibb have raced one another was their match at The Collins Cup where Ryf was self-admittedly not on form and “arguably shouldn’t have raced but didn’t want to let the team down”. Knibb took an ‘easy’ match victory and was disappointed that she didn’t get to race Daniela on her best day. Now is Knibb’s chance to take on a refreshed Ryf, who’s back and stronger than ever with a new mindset to training, racing and life in general.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The women’s start list is equally as stacked as the men&#8217;s, meaning that if Ryf or Knibb let slip even just a little, there will be many fierce competitors ready to pounce on them for the win! Skye Moench, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Paula Findlay</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/holly-lawrence""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Holly Lawrence</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/heather-jackson""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heather Jackson</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackie-hering""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jackie Hering</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/tamara-jewett""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tamara Jewett</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chelsea Sodaro</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are all names that could be very much in the mix come Saturday. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t forget to watch out for former short-course athlete </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/ashleigh-gentle""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ashleigh Gentle</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, who’s coming off a big win at Clash Miami. A few more races like that and she’s sure to shoot up the PTO World Rankings and become a shoo-in for the Collins Cup this August.</span></p>

<h2>Challenge Salou</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For those athletes staying in Europe, this weekend, the big half-distance race is Challenge Salou, which boasts a strong field looking to move up the rankings.</span></p>
<p><b>Date: Sunday 3 April<br />

<h3><strong>Women’s Race – Haug vs Nordén</strong></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the women’s race, Challenge Salou will make it two races in two weeks for Anne Haug and after a second-place finish in Lanzarote, behind </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/katrina-matthews""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kat Matthews</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> who scored an impressive 104.92 points, Haug will be eager to go one better and be standing on top of the podium. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It will be by no means an easy win for Haug – she will have to overcome the likes of Lisa Nordén who won Challenge Salou in 2021. Nordén has recently been training with </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-philipp""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Laura Philipp</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, who just became PTO World #1, so perhaps Nordén will be in equally strong form and be able to make it two-second place finishes for Haug in two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The long list of other female challengers is topped by Fenella Langridge. The Brit will be taking her brand new Trek Speed Concept out for its first race, having been flaunting the wind tunnel testing she’s been doing on Instagram, so let’s see how slick she is on course! Then there’s </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/laura-zimmermann""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Laura Zimmerman</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/justine-mathieux""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Justine Mathieux</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/elisabetta-curridori""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Elisabetta Curridori</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/india-lee""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">India Lee</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">… the list goes on! </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Short course superstar </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/vincent-luis""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vincent Luis</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is set to further build his middle-distance resumé with Salou being only his third middle distance race. Luis’s previous middle distances exploits include a second-place finish at 70.3 Indian Wells in 2021 behind Lionel Sanders – an incredible result given that he was knocked off his bike by a car after being sent off course. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Luis also finished eighth at the PTO 2020 Championship having received a two-minute penalty for drafting on the bike. That made his final gap to winner </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gustav Iden</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, 2 minutes and 15 seconds. Perhaps we’ll get to see that sprint finish later in the season!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Luis will be lining up alongside Miki Moerck Taagholt, Kristian Høgenhaug, Denis Chevrot, </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-laidlow""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sam Laidlow</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/clement-mignon""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Clement Mignon</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.

<h2>Ironman South Africa</h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Full distance racing is back! While there have already been a handful of middle distance races for pros to tick off, this is the first opportunity for those full distance specialists to flex – and the chance to walk away with the African Championship title.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Men’s Race – Skipper Starts The Season, Chartier Steps Up</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Top-ranked Athletes:</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/joe-skipper""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joe Skipper</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (PTO #7)<br />

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Favouring the full-distance, it’s no surprise that Joe Skipper has journeyed to South Africa to race and is the hands-down favourite to take the win. </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/justin-metzler""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Justin Metzler</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> teased Skipper during the Collins Cup press conference for only having “one speed” and not being able to match him and Jackson Laundry over the 100km distance… That one speed however is RAPID over the full distance. Finishing off 2021 with a 100 point score at </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/race/im-chattanooga/2021/results""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">IM Chattanooga</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, Skipper has been banking consistent miles over the offseason so can expect a strong start from the Brit.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Other notable mentions include Collin Chartier, taking on his first-ever full-distance race. Though they did not race in the same match at the Collins Cup, Skipper’s overall finish time was two minutes faster than Chartier so if it did come down to a sprint to the finish between the two, one might expect Skipper to be able to pull out some speed over the American… </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Home favourites </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/bradley-weiss""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bradley Weiss</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/matt-trautman""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Matt Trautman</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> will certainly be gunning to take the title of first South African across the line and will also be keen to get in the mix at the front of the race. Also, Jesper Svensson will be racing to overwrite his DNF at the race in 2021 and having clocked the fastest swim in 2021, he’ll no doubt be hoping to enter T1 in first and hold on for as long as he can!</span></p>

<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-bleymehl""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daniela Bleymehl</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> had a disappointing return to racing in Dubai earlier this year with a DNF, both her first 2022 race but also her first race since returning from maternity leave. Bleymehl has multiple 100+ point scores in her race record prior to maternity leave so it surely is only a matter of time before she’s back on top.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bleymehl will have the likes of Sarissa De Vries, winner of the World Long Distance Triathlon Championship in 2021, to contend with, as well as Emma Bilham, another strong competitor over the full distance. Kylie Simpson is also expected to be in the mix and with two 80+ point scores and one 34 point score contributing to her ranking of 55th this will surely be a chance to make a big leap in the rankings with a good result. </span></p>

<p>Back after a COVID-induced break, the 2021 Ironman 70.3 World Championships in St. George, Utah, has a sensational line-up of top-class competitors all hungry to claim victory after a year without the event. With Gustav Iden and Daniela Ryf on the start line, both 2019 champs have huge targets on their backs.</p>
<p>Here’s who to look out for in St. George this weekend.</p>
<h2>Key Info</h2>
<p>Date: 18 September<br />
Location: St. George, Utah<br />
Start Time: 13:00 UTC<br />
Prize Money: $350,000 – pays 15 deep $50,000 to $3,000<br />
Course: Lake swim, hilly bike, hilly run</p>
<h2>Top-ranked Athletes</h2>
<p><strong>Men</strong><br />
<a href=""https://protriathletesorg.kinsta.cloud/triathletes/gustav-iden-3335/"">Gustav Iden</a> (PTO #3) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-long"">Sam Long</a> (PTO #4) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniel-baekkegard"">Daniel Baekkegard</a> (PTO #10)</p>
<p><strong>Women</strong><br />
<a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniela-ryf"">Daniela Ryf</a> (PTO #1) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lucy-charles-barclay"">Lucy Charles-Barclay</a> (PTO #4) / <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/holly-lawrence"">Holly Lawrence</a> (PTO #5)</p>
<h2>Men’s Race</h2>
<p>2019 70.3 world champ and PTO 2020 Champion Gustav Iden is a strong favourite at the race. He can swim well, bike with the best and then outrun them – as evidenced by his fastest run split at the Collins Cup. If anyone’s going to take Iden down, the Norwegian will make them work for it.</p>
<p>Sam Long came second to Lionel Sanders at 70.3 St. George in May and while this course is a little different, it suits his strong bike-run combo. The question is, will the front of the race be too far out of reach after the swim for him to get to use his strength?</p>
<p>Daniel Baekkegard is a big challenger for the title. Imperious in his match-up at the Collins Cup, where he had the day’s third-fastest time, the Dane has no weaknesses and should be vying for the lead from the gun in St. George. A head-to-head with the Norwegians could provide a real battle to the line.</p>
<p>Tokyo Olympic Champion <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/kristian-blummenfelt""> Kristian Blummenfelt</a> could well be Iden’s biggest rival and following his World Triathlon title, is clearly in scintillating form. The pair have only fought it out at two 70.3 events previously: 70.3 Bahrain in 2019 – where Blummenfelt put Iden into second with the world-record time; and the 2019 world champs in Nice – where Blummenfelt came fourth. St. George’s hilly bike and run could favour Iden, but don’t be surprised to see two Norwegians on the podium.</p>
<p>While Long is ranked higher, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-kanute"">Ben Kanute</a> (PTO #11) has the all-round swim, bike and run speed that could see him finish as the best US athlete at the event. He had the fourth-fastest time at the Collins Cup behind Frodeno, Iden and Baekkegard, so is in great form but suffered in St. George in May only coming 26th.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/george-goodwin"">George Goodwin</a> (PTO #13) missed out on Collins Cup selection so will be all-in for 70.3 worlds. After taking third at the PTO 2020 champs in Daytona last December, the Brit showed his class to take the 70.3 European title in June. However, like Kanute, he had a substandard race in St. George this May with a 17th place finish.</p>
<h2>Look Out For</h2>
<p>All-star swimmer and fifth-fastest finisher at the Collins Cup, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-appleton"">Sam Appleton</a> (PTO #15) should be right up there.</p>
<p>The pedigree of nine-time world champ <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/javier-gomez""> Javier Gomez</a> (PTO #16) is always worth taking notice of.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/florian-angert"">Florian Angert</a> (PTO #23) is a swim-bike beast and just won Challenge Samorin.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry"">Jackson Laundry</a> (PTO #26) had the fourth-fastest run at the Collins Cup and that form could see him finish strong here too.</p>
<h2>Women’s Race</h2>
<p>Daniela Ryf bounced back after illness at the Collins Cup to win IM Switzerland on 5 September, but that effort is unlikely to dent her power here. Never too far behind in the swim, the Swiss star is peerless on the bike, creating insurmountable leads on her opponents. Because of that, we’ve not seen her pushed in a run battle but given Ryf’s already got five 70.3 world titles in the bag, it would be foolish to bet against her. She also won 70.3 St. George in May, so we know she races well over this terrain.</p>
<p>As in years past in Kona, Lucy Charles-Barclay could be Ryf’s biggest threat in St. George. Despite being ill at the Collins Cup, the 70.3 European champ put in the second-fastest time of the day. She’s bound to have a lead out the swim and if she can hold Ryf when the pass we’re all expecting happens, it’ll be a great running duel to the finish.</p>
<p>Holly Lawrence came second to Charles-Barclay at the 70.3 Euro champs but that was a week after winning 70.3 Des Moines stateside. A true all-rounder, Lawrence came closest to Ryf at the 2019 worlds on a course that didn’t suit her. Lawrence took sixth at 70.3 St. George in May but expect her to finish higher this weekend.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/emma-pallant"">Emma Pallant-Browne</a> (PTO #7) is a real star on the rise. Now coached by Tim Don, the South Africa-based Brit came third at St. George in May despite some gastro issues before coming second to Lawrence in Des Moines. Her recent form is exceptional with first at 70.3 Boulder, besting Lawrence at Escape From Alcatraz and setting the third-fastest time at the Collins Cup. With an improved swim, this uber-bike-runner could top the podium on Saturday.</p>
<p>She might be way down the PTO rankings, but <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/taylor-knibb""> Taylor Knibb</a> will be up at the top of many people’s lists for a win in St. George. The American, who took mixed relay silver in Tokyo, had the fastest split at the Collins Cup including the swiftest bike leg despite riding a road bike. A faster swimmer than Ryf, we could see Knibb working with Charles-Barclay on the bike then sticking with Ryf on the bike and running away to victory.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jeanni-metzler"">Jeanni Metzler</a> (PTO #11) took second behind Ryf at 70.3 St. George in May with a superb run that put her within five minutes of the champ. The hilly course suits her and she races well in the heat, so a podium certainly isn’t out of the question for the South African.</p>
<p>After beating Metzler and Anne Haug at the Collins Cup with the day’s fastest run, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackie-hering"">Jackie Hering</a> (PTO #15) won’t be flying under the radar this weekend. If she can limit her losses on the swim and hang tough on the bike, Hering is sure to improve on her eighth place from the race in May.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/ellie-salthouse"">Ellie Salthouse</a> (PTO #16) is another athlete who wouldn’t be out of place on the podium. The Aussie star has five middle-distance wins this season plus a win in her Collins Cup matchup. She’s a 70.3 specialist and a strong all-rounder who’s great in the heat so expect a strong performance.</p>
<p>When she’s on, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay"">Paula Findlay</a> (PTO #6) has the talent and speed to crush it. The PTO 2020 Champion has had a strong rather than stunning 2021 but came fourth at 70.3 St. George in May before being sidelined by injury. She wasn’t back to her best for the Collins Cup but if she’s on her game this weekend, the podium beckons.</p>
<h2>Look Out For</h2>
<p>Despite being more of an iron-distance specialist, <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/katrina-matthews"">Kat Matthews</a> (PTO #9) had the fourth-fastest time at the Collins Cup.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench"">Skye Moench</a> (PTO #10) will be toeing the line in her first 70.3 Worlds as was the top US-finisher at St. George in May with fifth place.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/imogen-simmonds"">Imogen Simmonds</a> (PTO #20) was second to Ryf at 70.3 Dubai and has the class to finish well here too.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro"">Chelsea Sodaro</a> (PTO #22) is proving herself a super-mom and just keeps getting stronger on her path back to the top after giving birth in March.</p>
<p><a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/tamara-jewett"">Tamara Jewett</a> (PTO #65) recently won Timberman with a 1:14:19 half marathon split – the third-fastest ever in a middle-distance race.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Team Europe Captains Natascha Badmann and Normann Stadler went hard out the gate by picking Daniela Ryf for the first-ever Collins Cup matchup. Ryf is, without doubt, one of the sport’s greats – a strong swimmer, an unbelievably powerful cyclist and a sensational runner.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Internationals Captains Lisa Bentley and Simon Whitfield matched the world #1 with the world #2 – Teresa Adam. Adam is an athlete who could put time into Ryf during the swim and one of the only athletes in the sport with a chance of matching the Swiss Miss on the bike. While the Kiwi’s run stats fall short of Ryf’s, Adam’s not raced since January – and never before in Europe – so her running form could surprise on Saturday.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In Taylor Knibb, Team US Captains Karen Smyers and Mark Allen went straight in for a tactical pick in match #1, pitting the speed of an up-and-coming short-course star against these two proven iron-distance champions. At the recent World Triathlon events in Canada, Knibb – the Collins Cup’s youngest competitor – showed she’s one of the sport’s best swimmers and bikers. Meanwhile, while her 1:21 run split at 70.3 Boulder is faster than Adam has ever produced over the distance. Add in the fact that this battle will be fought over 2km, 80km and 18km and Knibb is a genuine contender for the win.</p>

Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/paula-findlay""><span class=""s1"">Paula Findlay</span></a> (PTO #6)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lucy Charles-Barclay has shown herself to be adept at all distances but her tactics are well known to the other teams – use her swimming strength to make a gap, ride hard and try to maintain that buffer for the run. While the Brit might fulfil the first part of that gameplan in the water, her lead to a pair of stellar swimmers in Paula Findlay and double Olympic medallist Katie Zaferes might not be great enough to put her out of sight.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Findlay has beaten Charles-Barclay before, the Canadian running away to take the win at Challenge Daytona in 2019. Findlay’s bike stats also give her the edge on the second discipline so she could wipe out any swim deficit before the matchup is over.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Katie Zaferes is the second wildcard for Team US. While she’s unproven at middle-distance events, the American’s pedigree speaks for itself as a World Triathlon Champion and Tokyo 2020 bronze and silver medallist. An awesome swim, bike, runner with no weaknesses, Zaferes could show the other two what speed really is.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #3</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/anne-haug""><span class=""s1"">Anne Haug</span></a> (PTO #3)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackie-hering""><span class=""s1"">Jackie Hering</span></a> (PTO #15)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jeanni-metzler""><span class=""s1"">Jeanni Metzler</span></a> (PTO #11)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Match #3 will be a battle of the runners. Team Europe’s Anne Haug is widely considered the sport’s best in the third discipline – reflected in a running rating of 100%. That means the only tactic for Team US and Team Internationals will be to put time into the German before the run begins.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Jeanni Metzler is an incredible runner herself, with a fastest half-marathon split of 1:15:26 this season. On paper, the South African should beat both Haug and Hering out the water, too. So, if she can hold an advantage by T2, she could take the win.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Hering shares the same 84% swim rating as Haug, so the two could well hit the bike together. If that’s after Metzler, there could be some tactical plays when it comes to whose job it is to lead the charge.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Metzler has beaten Hering in three of their last four races together – though it was the American who took the most recent scalp. However, Haug thrashed them both at the PTO 2020 Championship at Challenge Daytona.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #4</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/holly-lawrence""><span class=""s1"">Holly Lawrence</span></a> (PTO #5)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/skye-moench""><span class=""s1"">Skye Moench</span></a> (PTO #10)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/ellie-salthouse""><span class=""s1"">Ellie Salthouse</span></a> (PTO #16)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Holly Lawrence is a seriously tough competitor and a middle-distance specialist who’s highly accomplished in all three disciplines. But that doesn’t mean it’ll be a walkover for Team Europe in match #4.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Lawrence is likely to lead this trio out the water but Ellie Salthouse, who’s also a great swimmer and a middle-distance maestro herself, could stay on the Brit’s toes then force her to work on the bike.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While Moench might lose a bit of time in the swim, she’s the strongest cyclist of the three and beat Lawrence the last time they raced together at 70.3 St George. So unless there’s a significant gap, it could all come back together by T2 – leaving the race to be decided on the run.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">All three athletes are well-matched here but with no love lost between Lawrence and Salthouse, the Aussie – who’s undefeated in 2021 over middle-distance – could have the extra motivation to clinch victory.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #5</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/emma-pallant""><span class=""s1"">Emma Pallant-Browne</span></a> (PTO #7)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/chelsea-sodaro""><span class=""s1"">Chelsea Sodaro</span></a> (PTO #22)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sarah-crowley""><span class=""s1"">Sarah Crowley</span></a> (PTO #13)</p>
<p class=""p1"">On paper, match #5 should be a win for Team Europe. With her overall ranking of 94%, Emma Pallant-Browne’s only slight weakness is in the swim though she still trumps Sodaro and Crowley in that department.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Even if American super-mom, Sodaro, and iron-distance Aussie, Crowley, can stick to the Brit’s feet in the water, it’s unlikely they’ll drop her on the bike – Pallant-Browne has shown she’s a match for anyone but Daniela Ryf on two wheels.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On the run, Pallant-Browne is impeccable, her fastest split a 1:16:54 this season. Could we see the Brit take extra points for a match domination? It could be on the cards.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Either way, the more exciting battle could be for second place between Sodaro, who’s still on the upward swing back to her best after returning from maternity leave, and Crowley, the iron-distance powerhouse whose skillset might not suit this shorter course.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #6</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/kat-matthews""><span class=""s1"">Kat Matthews</span></a> (PTO #9)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jocelyn-mccauley""><span class=""s1"">Jocelyn McCauley</span></a> (PTO #41)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/carrie-lester""><span class=""s1"">Carrie Lester</span></a> (PTO #8)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Match #6 is a battle of long-course warriors. All three women have performed over the iron distance this season – and all broken the nine-hour barrier in the process.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With higher swimming rankings, there’s a chance the McCauley and Lester could edge out Matthews on the swim. Lester would then be hoping to use her bike prowess – she’s rated 96% – to make a gap before the run.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Both Lester and McCauley will need time on Kat Matthews before the run as the Brit has shown she’s an athlete to be feared on the final leg. Matthews ran 2:49:48 for the marathon in May – the fastest time of the last five years. That said, the 18km finale isn’t ideally suited to any of these iron-forged specialists, so there could be an upset by the finish line.</p>
<h2 class=""p1"">Men’s Matches</h2>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #7</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jan-frodeno""><span class=""s1"">Jan Frodeno</span></a> (PTO #1)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-long""><span class=""s1"">Sam Long</span></a> (PTO #4)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sam-appleton""><span class=""s1"">Sam Appleton</span></a> (PTO #15)</p>
<p class=""p1"">With the world #1 ranking, the iron-distance world record and a winning streak that goes back to the start of the 2018 season, everyone is expecting Jan Frodeno to perform at the Collins Cup. That puts a huge target on his back and gives both the German’s competitors extra incentive to be the one to topple the champ.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A superb swimmer, Sam Appleton should be out the water with Frodeno but will need to pull out something special on the bike as Frodeno’s 99% run rating is significantly higher than his own 85%. Perhaps the safe bet will be to shadow Frodeno for as long as possible and try to score maximum points over Sam Long – then again, where’s the fun in that?</p>
<p class=""p1"">At just 25, Long has rocketed to the top of the sport with a massive bike-run combo and the personality to match. The Big Unit will be desperate to beat Frodo and while his bike is ranked higher – 99% versus 94% – the American might just lose too much time in the swim to make it count. One thing’s for sure though, Long won’t let up for a second in the chase – recently coming from behind to beat Appleton in Boulder, which is sure to give him a psychological edge.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #8</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/gustav-iden""><span class=""s1"">Gustav Iden</span></a> (PTO #3)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/rudy-von-berg""><span class=""s1"">Rudy Von Berg</span></a> (PTO #8)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/kyle-smith""><span class=""s1"">Kyle Smith</span></a> (PTO #27)</p>
<p class=""p1"">As PTO 2020 Champion and reigning 70.3 world champ, Norway’s Gustav Iden is the real deal. An athlete who gets stronger as the race progresses through the disciplines, it’s Iden’s run that earned him both titles – beating Rudy Von Berg on both occasions.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Von Berg will be seeking to distance Iden in the swim and with a similar pace through the water as Kyle Smith, the pair could work well over the 2km to put a little time into Iden. Von Berg is higher-ranked on the bike than Smith but the Kiwi is no slouch having ridden sub-two-hours in a half this year.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The pair will need quite a buffer to stave off the Norwegian’s inexorable run speed, but there’s a chance Iden could simply run out of road to make the catch.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While Smith appears the underdog of the match-up, he definitely shouldn’t be counted out for the win. The New Zealander had the fastest swim and bike times at the 70.3 European champs in June and with a shorter run, this could be the perfect distance for him.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #9</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/sebastian-kienle""><span class=""s1"">Sebastian Kienle</span></a> (PTO #19)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/andrew-starykowicz""><span class=""s1"">Andrew Starykowicz</span></a> (PTO #33)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/lionel-sanders""><span class=""s1"">Lionel Sanders</span></a> (PTO #2)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sebastian Kienle’s form coming into the Collins Cup is a complete unknown. He’s been rehabbing injuries and hasn’t raced since May. If he’s back to his best, the German’s a true warrior who will stop at nothing – this is a man who rode an entire 180km bike leg with a piece of glass digging into his foot.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lionel Sanders wanted the match-up against Sebastian Kienle, who he’s battled with twice before at Challenge Samorin and come out on top both times. The pair are similarly matched in the swim but Sanders should have the edge on the bike and run. However, he’s just a week post a big iron-distance race in Copenhagen so whether he’s firing on all cylinders could make the difference here.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While Sanders is ranked 100% on the bike, Starykowicz – who’s ranked 99% – has a long reputation as the sport’s most dominant cyclist. A late call-up for the Collins Cup, Starykowicz is also a better swimmer than both Kienle and Sanders, so should be off up the road before that pairing leaves the water. Realistically, though, he’ll need at least five minutes in hand to have a chance at victory, which could be just too much in a race this length.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #10</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/daniel-baekkegard""><span class=""s1"">Daniel Baekkegard</span></a> (PTO #10)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/ben-kanute""><span class=""s1"">Ben Kanute</span></a> (PTO #11)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/max-neumann""><span class=""s1"">Max Neumann</span></a> (PTO #17)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Based on the rankings, this is one of the closest Collins Cup matchups we’ll get to see on Saturday. Daniel Baekkegard, Ben Kanute and Max Neumann are all spectacular swimmers and will surely stay together in the water. They’re also bike and run powerhouses, all ranked within a couple of percent of each other.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Baekkegard is an athlete everyone’s been talking about – his win at 70.3 Bahrain this year was the third-fastest ever over the distance, probably making him the one to beat here.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Kanute, meanwhile, has shown he can maintain his short-course speed alongside his middle-distance focus. If anything, this slightly shorter bike and run distance only favours the American, who recently took his fourth straight victory at Escape From Alcatraz, an iconic standard-distance race.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Neumann is the least known of the three but is a double IM Asia Pacific Champion. Don’t let those iron-distance wins fool you though, the Aussie is a seriously fast athlete who’s run 1:10 this season.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">All in all, this one’s too close to call.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #11</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/patrick-lange""><span class=""s1"">Patrick Lange</span></a> (PTO #7)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/matt-hanson""><span class=""s1"">Matt Hanson</span></a> (PTO #9)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/braden-currie""><span class=""s1"">Braden Currie</span></a> (PTO #6)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Braden Currie is an incredibly consistent performer. He’s not had the chance to race outside his native New Zealand over the last two years, so will be desperate to test himself against this tough competition. The strongest swimmer in the match and equal to the others on the bike, his run ranking is also just 1% lower than Patrick Lange’s at 96%.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A two-time Kona winner, Lange is arguably the world’s best iron-distance runner. However, while the German excels over the longer races, his middle-distance palmares aren’t quite of the same calibre, his last win coming in 2017.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lange’s improved swim-bike could be crucial in the match, especially if he can stick behind Braden Currie in the water to distance Matt Hanson. If the pair reaches T2 with an advantage, we should be in for an exciting shoulder-to-shoulder run.</p>
<p class=""p1"">However, with a 100% run rating, Matt Hanson could have the speed to close down anything but a colossal lead. Throughout 2021, the American has proven himself the best middle-distance runner in the world, seemingly constantly surging through the field to put in race-best splits. If Hanson reaches T2 with the others, Team US could score top points here.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Match #12</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Team Europe &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/joe-skipper""><span class=""s1"">Joe Skipper</span></a> (PTO #5)<br />
Team US &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/justin-metzler""><span class=""s1"">Justin Metzler</span></a> (PTO #54)<br />
Team Internationals &#8211; <a href=""https://protriathletes.org/athlete/jackson-laundry""><span class=""s1"">Jackson Laundry</span></a> (PTO #26)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Team US Captains’ Pick, Justin Metzler, was brought onto the team on the back of his great second-place at IM Coeur d’Alene and fifth-place at 70.3 Boulder recently. Metzler’s ace card here is his swim, where he could distance both his competitors and solo away to build a lead.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Jackson Laundry comes to the Collins Cup in rising form after going third, second and first in his last three races. If he’s within hailing distance of Metzler after T1, the pair could work well together on the bike to keep Skipper at bay. Metzler and Laundry are ranked at 89 and 90% on the run so we should see a good battle between the two.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Joe Skipper is one of the fastest bike-runners in the business with a 96% bike rating and 100% run rating – credentials he’s often underlined at iron-distance races. At the middle distance, he’s less consistent and has yet to put a win against his scorecard. There’s no doubting his talent though, he could yet pull something out the bag – if he can overturn what’s likely to be a significant swim deficit.</p>
<h2 class=""p1"">History In The Making</h2>
<p class=""p1"">With such an array of talented and well-matched athletes going head-to-head in this totally new race format, triathlon history will be made on Saturday. Not only is the team dynamic new to long-course triathlon but with Team Captains able to help shape race outcomes through radio communications and access to athlete data, it’ll be a fascinating new take on what the sport of swim, bike and run can be.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The race coverage gets underway at 12:30 CEST on Saturday but there’s plenty more to watch on the <a href=""https://thecollinscup.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/""><span class=""s1"">Collins Cup website</span></a> or iOS/Android app before then including both parts of the PTO’s Beyond Human documentary and the Battle For Glory and Greater Than One video series.</p>

<p class=""p1"">After the fun of the Tokyo tri fantasy game, which featured over 1,300 participants, the stakes are higher this time around. While the Collins Cup Fantasy Competition is completely free to play there’s a Grand Prize of an all-expenses-paid trip for two to the 2022 Collins Cup on the line – the trip of a lifetime for any triathlon fan.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Meanwhile, second-and third-place finishers will bag a TAG Heuer connected watch. There are also plenty of prizes to be won courtesy of Wahoo, the event’s Official Transition Partner, including a Wahoo KICKR Bike for fourth place, Wahoo KICKR Smart Trainers for fifth and sixth place and Wahoo ELEMNT RIVAL multisport watches for seventh to 10th place.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If that whets your appetite to give it a go, read on for how to get started with the Collins Cup Fantasy Competition.</p>
<h2>Collins Cup Fantasy Competition – How To Play</h2>
<p class=""p1"">The Collins Cup Fantasy Competition gets underway immediately after the Collins Cup opening ceremony on Wednesday 25 August. It’s here we’ll get to find out which athletes will be pitted against one another in all 12 of the race matchups – as well as getting a chance to see all the stars resplendent in their new race kit.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Once those all-important matchups have been decided in the Captain’s Match Draft Draw, the game is afoot! All you need to do is pick who you think will finish first, second and third in every matchup.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">First place athletes are worth 300 points, second 200 points and third 100 points. There are also bonus points for the first two athletes across the line based on the time gap to their competitors.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For each correct guess, you’ll be awarded that athlete’s points. So, if you correctly predict a trifecta the points will really rack up in your favour! The more points you have at the end of the day, the higher you’ll be ranked – but can you make it into the top 10 to earn a prize?</p>
<p class=""p1"">Like the previous tri fantasy games, success at the Collins Cup Fantasy Competition will take all your athlete knowledge and a big slice of luck. While we can’t help with the latter, now is the time to brush up on everything you need to know about all the Collins Cup athletes through our <a href=""https://stats.staging-ptowebsitelivewp.kinsta.cloud/""><span class=""s1"">PTO Stats site</span></a>.<span class=""Apple-converted-space""> </span></p>

</ol>
<p>Teresa Adam has been hunkered in New Zealand during Covid but has still put in some incredible performances throughout the Collins Cup qualification period. The Kiwi scored big points at three IM races over 2019 and 2020 and the Port of Tauranga Half this year. A great swimmer and superb biker, her run is the unknown for her competitors.</p>
<p>Paula Findlay made a big name for herself by winning the PTO 2020 Championships at Challenge Daytona last December. The Canadian followed that up with seventh at Challenge Miami and a gutsy never-say-die performance for fourth at 70.3 St. George. She’s just come good after a running injury but if she’s back to her best, she’s one of the strongest all-rounders in the business.</p>
<p>Carrie Lester secured her Collins Cup place thanks to three Ironman wins in 2019 and a sensationally fast sub-nine victory at IM Coeur d’Alene in June. The Aussie is a great swimmer and runner but a real powerhouse on the bike, which is sure to feature in the tactics of the Team Captains.</p>
<p>South Africa’s Jeanni Metzler has had a fantastic 2021 season, seeking out races against the best and coming away with second at 70.3 Texas and St. George and third at 70.3 Boulder. Each time she’s unleashed a ferocious run pace that’ll worry any of her potential matchups at the Collins Cup.</p>
<p>Sarah Crowley has twice finished third in Kona and was also the 2017 World Triathlon Long Distance champion, underlining her credentials to race with aplomb when it really counts. By her exceptionally high standards, Crowley didn’t shine quite as brightly at the start of 2021. However, first at 70.3 Ecuador in July signalled the Australian is on the way back to her best and was enough for her to gain a Captains Pick slot.</p>
<p>Ellie Salthouse comes into the Collins Cup unbeaten in 2021 over six middle-distance races including 70.3 Geelong and, most recently, 70.3 Andorra. The team’s third Aussie is certainly one of the form athletes of the season and given the Collins Cup’s 2km swim, 80km bike and 18km run format, she could well be the strongest of the women’s competitors.</p>

</ol>
<p>The Team Internationals men are headed by Lionel Sanders. Undoubtedly one of the world’s best 70.3 athletes and a true fighter, Sanders has a second at Challenge Miami and wins at 70.3 Texas and St. George this season – both against highly competitive fields. He also set a new iron-distance PB at the Tri Battle Royale and backed that up with second at IM Copenhagen last weekend. A middle-distance ace, while he might lose time in the swim, he’s got the bike-run to have the others running scared. Plus, he’s won twice in Samorin previously at Challenge The Championship.</p>
<p>Winner of his native IM New Zealand this year, Braden Currie is a supremely consistent athlete who’s truly talented across all three disciplines. Outside of his top-10 showings at the 70.3 worlds and Kona, he’s not finished off the podium since late 2017. While he’s yet to face an international field in 2021, he’s got the full swim-bike-run package to go toe-to-toe with the best the other teams can muster.</p>
<p>Sam Appleton is a middle-distance specialist with a stacked resume of 15 wins and 25 podiums. Sixth at the PTO 2020 Championships last December, this swim-bike monster races from the front but also has the goods on the run to close it out for the win. His second at 70.3 Boulder recently shows he’s in great form and the Collins Cup format should suit his swimming strengths.</p>
<p>Max Neumann goes into the Collins Cup after wins at Challenge Shepparton and IM Cairns this year, successfully defending his title from 2020 at the latter. Another of the young no-weaknesses breed, the Australian has it where it counts in each discipline but is an incredible swimmer who’s likely to make time on his competitors. The biggest question mark is that he’s not raced outside of Australia over the last two years, so we’ll have to wait to see if that’s to his advantage or disadvantage come the matchup.</p>
<p>The first Captains Pick athlete for Team Internationals is rising 70.3 star, Kyle Smith. The 23-year-old Kiwi won his first five middle-distance events before showing serious grit to take third at his first full at IM New Zealand in March. Another sensational swimmer, Smith led from the water at the 70.3 Euro champs in Elsinore where he also had the fastest bike split before fading towards the end of the run to fifth. With that swim-bike strength and a shorter 18km run at the Collins Cup, he could well solo to victory.</p>
<p>Jackson Laundry has made his desire to represent Team Internationals clear over the qualifying period but it’s his rising form in 2021 that surely caught the Captains’ eyes. The Canadian took third at 70.3 Des Moines, second at Rev3 Williamsburg and first at 70.3 Ecuador. He might not match the very fastest for swim speed but his quality bike-run package makes him a strong pick.</p>
<p>With some of the world’s classiest athletes and a diverse range of swim, bike and run strength, Team Internationals have the talent to score big points in Samorin.</p>
<p>We’ll get to see which athletes will be pitted against each other at the Match Draft Draw, part of the opening ceremony on Wednesday 25 August at 18:00 CEST.</p>

Here’s the full US roster for the big race on 28 August.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Team US has been labelled as the underdog in the run-up to the first-ever Collins Cup event. But with a line-up of mentally and physically strong athletes who are highly motivated to take the Collins Cup trophy for triathlon’s founding nation, they shouldn’t be counted out.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In fact, with the Captains Picks adding two Olympic medallists to the women’s side of the team, their chances of causing an upset have jumped up drastically. Here’s the lowdown on the full team and why the Stars-and-Stripes are serious contenders for the Collins Cup.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Skye Moench has cemented her place as the USA number one thanks to a string of powerful performances including the win at 70.3 Texas in April and third at Ironman Tulsa in May. Moench also showed off her solid swim, superb bike and strong run as the top Stars-and-Stripes finisher at 70.3 St. George, coming fifth in a championship-quality field. While she’s an Ironman star, fifth at the shorter distance Challenge Miami also bodes well for the Collins Cup.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With her great swim and bike rankings plus a sensational run that’s up there with the best, Jackie Hering is a quality athlete across the board. This year she’s had some great performances including third at both Challenge Miami and 70.3 Des Moines as well as two more 70.3 top-10 finishes. If Hering brings her freshest running legs to the Collins Cup, she could certainly pull in the points for Team US.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chelsea Sodaro (PTO #22) returned from maternity leave to come sixth at 70.3 Boulder on the final weekend of Collins Cup qualification races, giving her enough points to squeeze into the fourth position for the US – fulfilling the dream laid out in her Greater Than One video series. Before that, her 2019 season features three 70.3 wins and as a strong athlete in all three disciplines, this super-mom could show up her rivals.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Jocelyn McCauley was drafted into the team after original qualifier Heather Jackson pulled out of the race for personal reasons. McCauley’s a strong replacement, however, having returned from maternity leave to take second place at IM Finland. Already back to fine form on the swim and bike, if she can sharpen her run just a little, she could be a real asset to Team US in Samorin.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For both the Captains Picks, Karen Smyers and Mark Allen have gone straight to the top. Tokyo 2020 Olympic Bronze medallist Katie Zaferes, who also took Silver in the Mixed Relay event, is their first choice. What a choice it is. One of the best in the business, the 2019 World Triathlon Champion is a front-pack swimmer, breakaway biker and stellar runner. While this is a longer distance than she’s previously competed at, there won’t be many from the other teams who can match her.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second pick is fellow Olympian athlete Taylor Knibb, who was also part of that Silver-winning relay team in Japan. After quickly making a name for herself as a sensational swimmer and the strongest cyclist on the World Triathlon circuit, Knibb stepped up to middle distance for the first time at 70.3 Boulder earlier this month. Finishing in second, she rode just 26-seconds slower than winner Pallant-Browne despite being on a road bike. </span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the men’s side, Sam Long leads the pack. He’s in stellar form after victories at IM Coeur d’Alene and 70.3 Boulder and we’ve also seen how deep he can push in a head-to-head battle when he went to the line against Lionel Sanders at 70.3 St. George. One of the sport’s fastest bike-runners – and still far from his potential at just 25 years old – Long could do serious damage to his competitors in Samorin.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Like Long, Rudy Von Berg scored a victory earlier this month by taking the tape at 70.3 Switzerland. A fantastic athlete in all three disciplines, Von Berg is a picture of consistency having been in the top five for all but one of his last 25 races – 10 of which were wins. With no weaknesses, he’ll be a contender no matter the matchup.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Through the 2020-2021 season Matt Hanson has proven himself as the sport’s best middle-distance runner, taking the fastest splits at five out of the last six events he’s raced – including the PTO 2020 Championships in Daytona, where he came second. He’s got a good swim and a fast bike too, so if he hits T2 at the same time as his opponents, he’s odds-on for victory at the Collins Cup.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ben Kanute is without doubt one of the sport’s most versatile athletes. Able to race hard and fast over a plethora of distances, Kanute is a highly accomplished all-rounder with a weapon swim that’s seen him take third at Challenge Miami, second at 70.3 Texas and first at Escape From Alcatraz in 2021. That win – his fourth at the iconic event – came on 15 August, showing he’s in fine form.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another strong all-rounder, Captains Pick recipient Justin Metzler is a classy athlete who’s been racing well this season with three top-10 results including second at IM Coeur d’Alene and fifth at 70.3 Boulder. To add a little familial drama to the Collins Cup, Justin’s wife, Jeanni Metzler, is racing for Team Internationals, which could cause sparks to fly in race week!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The captains’ other pick, Chris Leiferman, has had to forego his slot due to injury, which has paved the way for alternate Andrew Starykowicz to be called up. A strong swimmer and the uber-biker&#8217;s uber-biker, Starykowicz took first at Rev3 Williamsburg earlier this year and is a tactical pick if ever the was one. A player of mind games and speaker of frank views, Starykowicz will bring as much in the way of controversial asides as his pure cycling power.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With a ton of talent across the team and two seriously decorated Captains calling the shots, the right matchups could see the US top the points table in Samorin. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With both the men’s and women’s PTO World #1 athletes in Daniela Ryf and Jan Frodeno, Team Europe have been favourites for the Collins Cup for some time. But there’s more to the team than these two contenders for greatest-of-all-time status.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The incredible strength-in-depth across long-course triathlon in Europe is staggering with all but one of Team Europe’s athletes ranked within the PTO top-10. Great Britain is the most well-represented with five athletes, then there are four from Germany and one each from Switzerland, Norway and Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There aren’t any weak links in terms of athletic prowess – just a few question marks around how the iron-distance specialists such as Kat Matthews, Joe Skipper and Patrick Lange could fare against the best middle-distance maestros from Team US and Team Internationals.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It was no surprise that Daniela Ryf retained her PTO #1 spot throughout the qualifying period to lead Team Europe’s women incredible list of women. The nine-time world champ has continually raised the game of long-course triathlon to leave others playing catch-up. The Swiss star has continued her dominance in 2021, taking four-from-four victories.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Like Ryf, Anne Haug is also a Kona winner having taken victory in 2019. The German is a good swimmer and strong biker, but it’s Haug’s run that strikes fear into the competition. She’s still getting quicker, too, beasting Challenge St Polten earlier this year with a 1:14:07 run split – the fastest ever at a middle-distance race.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lucy Charles-Barclay is the sport’s preeminent swimmer at any distance but she’s also proved her bike and run class time and again – including her 70.3 European Championship win in Elsinore this June. The Brit has also raced well in Samorin previously having won Challenge Samorin in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2016 70.3 world champ Holly Lawrence is a true all-rounder who can out-swim, out-bike and out-run the majority of the pro field. The Brit comes into the Collins Cup having already beaten some of the other teams’ athletes at 70.3 Des Moines this year. She also came second at the 70.3 European champs this year.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Captains’ pick Emma-Pallant Browne might not match the uber-swimmers for speed, but she certainly makes up for it in cycling power and foot speed. Seemingly able to bridge gaps on the bike with ease then run away from the rest, the Brit has topped the podium at four of her six races this year – and taken second and third at the others.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kat Matthews is the fourth Brit in Team Europe and comes to the race in rising form, most recently winning Ironman UK and before that coming second to Daniel Ryf at IM Tulsa. It was there that she ran a 2:49:48 marathon, the fastest of any woman in the last five years.</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The men’s side of the team is no less decorated. PTO #1 Jan Frodeno leads the charge. The five-time world champion is rightly regarded as the sport’s best and hasn’t lost a race since 2017. On top of that, he’s just set a new iron-distance world record of 7:27:53 showing the German’s not slowing down.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Norway’s Gustav Iden comes to the Collins Cup as reigning 70.3 World Champion and PTO 2020 World Champion having won Challenge Daytona in spectacular fashion last December. An eighth at the Olympic Games since then will only have improved his middle-distance form.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joe Skipper is a thoroughbred racing monster with the confidence and attitude to match. He’s likely to lose time in the swim, but the Brit is holder of the fastest ever Ironman bike-run combo. More an iron-distance specialist. Skipper won Ironman UK earlier this year with a colossal run effort of 2:41:44 on a very challenging course.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Two-time Kona winner Patrick Lange is known as one of the fastest iron-distance runners ever but his exceptional performance to win Ironman Tulsa in May shows he really is a complete athlete. With a great swim, much-improved bike and staggering run, the German will be a fearsome matchup if he can translate that speed to middle-distance.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Daniel Baekkegard must’ve been an easy pick for the Team Europe Captains, being one of the athletes that everyone is talking about in 2021. After kicking off the season with the win at 70.3 Dubai, he raced 70.3 St. George where despite a confusing DQ, the Dane showed his all-around swim-bike-run class in a championship-quality field. The grit he showed to hang tough and come third at IM Tulsa must only have made Baekkegard a more appealing choice for Team Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sebastian Kienle is the biggest surprise pick from the Team Europe Captains – not because of his considerable resumé, which includes two 70.3 world titles, a Kona win and the course record at Challenge Samorin – but because of the injuries that have seen him at less than 100 percent this season. He’s not raced since May so this pick from captains Natascha Badmann and Normann Stadler surely means the German is back to his best – and that’s a frightening prospect for the other teams.</span></p>
